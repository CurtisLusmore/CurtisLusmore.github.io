          I am a software developer specialising in building backend
          applications and services in the .NET stack. I have broad experience
          across the full software development life-cycle, from vision and
          design through to development, delivery and marketing. I am
          passionate about problem solving, software development methodology,
          software craftmanship, programming language design, learning and
          teaching.

          I worked on a number of enterprise software products, both SaaS and
          on-premises, using the Microsoft .NET stack and Azure. My technical
          contributions ranged from low-level networking libraries to
          high-level solution architectures, and my non-technical contributions
          from mentoring staff to presenting to customers and vendor partners.

        <h3>Workshop Facilitator</h3>
        <h4>Queensland University of Technology—July 2011 to July 2014</h4>
        <p>
          As a Workshop Facilitator, I taught programming to hundreds of
          university students. During this period I developed my passion for
          sharing knowledge and seeing people grow. I got the opportunity to
          see the moment when things first started to click for my first-year
          students, and then to see them again as final-year students and see
          how much they’d grown.
        </p>
        <p>Key accomplishments:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Teaching introductory programming in Python</li>
          <li>Teaching data structures and algorithms in C++</li>
          <li>Running hundreds of workshops of 40+ students</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Key learnings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Effective communication and interpersonal skills</li>
          <li>Tailoring to the diverse learning styles of hundreds of
            students</li>
          <li>Passion for knowledge sharing and seeing others grow</li>
        </ul>
