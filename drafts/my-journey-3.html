          This is the third part in a series describing my journey as a
          programmer. Here are the other parts:

          Having spent my teenage years making primitive games, building IRC
          bots, and programming my calculator, it was time to move on to
          university. I decided to continue my programming studies, along with
          my other favourite subjects—mathematics and graphics (working with
          CAD software)—in a Bachelor of Engineering majoring in something
          called Infomechatronics, which I believe is a mashup of the words
          “information”, “mechanics” and “electronics”. I lasted all of one
          semester before switching out.

          It was the physics course that did it. I never took physics in high
          school, and I just couldn’t get into it, particularly in contrast to
          the engineering mathematics course. In mathematics, we learnt how to
          derive things from first principles, we built up results from
          existing results and simple assumptions, we learnt how to
          <a href="/posts/computer-science-as-exploration">explore</a> the
          space of all mathematical ideas. The physics course, on the other
          hand, was more about memorising formulae that others had already
          discovered. So I switched to a Bachelor of Mathematics.
