          Warning: Everything in this area is a work-in-progress. If you’re
          curious what I’m thinking about at the moment, you can read about it

            This post is a seed. A lot of the things I’ve been thinking about
            over the last few years can ultimately be traced back to this
            thought, so I want to try planting this seed into your brain, to see
            what will grow from it when watered with your experiences.

            What is computer science really about? In the present day, despite
            being such a relatively young and immature field, computer science
            employs millions of people all over the world, it produces the
            technologies that run our lives, and it is responsible for countless
            billions or trillions of dollars of value. Even going into the
            near-term future, the software that has been built over the last few
            decades will continue to affect the daily lives of our
            great-great-great-grandchildren.
