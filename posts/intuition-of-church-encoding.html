  <h1>Intuition of Church Encoding</h1>
</header>
<section>
  <p>
    After first being introduced to the concept of Church numerals in
    <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure and Interpretation
    of Computer Programs</a>, I decided to learn more about them and the
    more general topic,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church
    encoding</a>. For those who don’t know, Church encoding defines a way
    to represent common data types and structures in the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda
    calculus</a> using only functions, since functions are the only terms
    available.
  </p>
  <p>
    I eventually stumbled upon a pretty neat intuition for how Church
    encodings work, which enables you to create encodings for arbitrary
    data types very easily. But first, a little on how I got there…
  </p>
  <p>
    I started with the Wikipedia entry, which has a decent amount of
    examples but is lacking in providing any real intuition into how they
    work. As an example, the Church encoding for booleans are listed as
    follows.
  </p>
  <pre><code>true  = λa. λb. a
false = λa. λb. b
</code></pre>
  <p>
    These two functions are the simplest possible two distinct terms,
    ignoring the identity function so that there can at least be some
    symmetry (same number of arguments), so in that sense it may seem
    intuitive to use them. And I can accept that it’s convention in the
    Lambda calculus to use single letter identifiers, but still I can’t
    help but wonder what more meaningful identifiers I would use—<wbr>what do
    they actually mean?
  </p>
  <p>
    The Church encoding for natural numbers is a little better.
  </p>
  <pre><code>zero = λf. λx. x
succ = λn. λf. λx. f (n f x)
</code></pre>
  <p>
    The common intuition for this encoding is that the encoded
    <code>n</code> represents a function that takes another function
    <code>f</code> as an argument and returns a new function which
    applies <code>f</code> to its argument <code>n</code> times. This is
    backed up by observing that <code>zero</code> takes any function
    <code>f</code> and simply returns the identity function—<wbr>application
    of <code>f</code> zero times does nothing. That’s more satisfying,
    but I do wonder if it’s a coincidence that zero is alpha equivalent
    to false.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next up, lists—<wbr>and this time, an even better standard intuition.
  </p>
  <pre><code>nil = λc. λn. n
cons = λh. λt. λc. λn. c h (t c n)
</code></pre>
  <p>
    The intuition is that a list is encoded as a <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_%28higher-order_function%29"
    >fold function</a>, although it might be difficult to see from these
    terms. And now I’m really starting to doubt that it’s mere
    coincidence that yet again we have an alpha equivalence with
    <code>false</code>, this time in the encoding of <code>nil</code>.
  </p>

    <a href="#1">Implementation in Haskell</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    It was about this time that I decided to try implementing them in
    <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>. There are a few
    implementations out there on the internet already but I wanted to try
    it from scratch. To start with, I figured I’d just bash in the
    definitions without type signatures and see what I get.
  </p>
  <h3>Church booleans</h3>
  <pre class="haskell">
λ let true' = \a b -> a
λ :t true'
true' :: t1 -> t -> t1

λ let false' = \a b -> b
λ :t false'
false' :: t -> t1 -> t1
</code></pre>
  <p>
    Defining a type that works in all the ways I would like is a little
    trickier than I expected, but not too difficult.
  </p>
  <pre class="haskell">
{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}

newtype Bool' = Bool' { runBool' :: forall a. a -> a -> a }

true' :: Bool'
true' = Bool' $ \a b -> a

false' :: Bool'
false' = Bool' $ \a b -> b
</code></pre>
  <h3>Church numerals</h3>
  <pre class="haskell">
λ let zero' = \f x -> x
λ :t zero'
zero' :: t -> t1 -> t1

λ let succ' = \n f x -> f (n f x)
λ :t succ'
succ' :: ((t1 -> t) -> t2 -> t1) -> (t1 -> t) -> t2 -> t
</code></pre>
  <p>
    The trick for this one is in recognising that the first argument to
    <code>succ’</code> is supposed to be a numeral, so its type signature
    in <code>succ’</code> should give us a good place to start.
  </p>
  <pre class="haskell">
newtype Nat' = Nat' { runNat' :: forall a. (a -> a) -> a -> a }

zero' :: Nat'
zero' = Nat' $ \f x -> x

succ' :: Nat' -> Nat'
succ' n = Nat' $ \f x -> f (runNat' n f x)
</code></pre>
  <h3>Church lists</h3>
  <pre class="haskell">
λ let nil' = \c n -> n
λ :t nil'
nil' :: t -> t1 -> t1

λ let cons' = \h t c n -> c h (t c n)
λ :t cons'
cons' :: t1 -> ((t1 -> t2 -> t) -> t3 -> t2) -> (t1 -> t2 -> t) -> t3 -> t
</code></pre>
  <p>
    Again, the trick here was in recognising that the return type after
    two arguments is a list.
  </p>
  <pre class="haskell">
newtype List' a = List'
  { runList' :: forall b. (a -> b -> b) -> b -> b
  }

nil' :: List' a
nil' = List' $ \c n -> n

cons' :: a -> List' a -> List' a
cons x xs = List' $ \c n -> c x (runList' xs c n)
</code></pre>
  <h2 id="2">
    <a href="#2">Comparison with standard definitions</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    At this point I thought it would be interesting to compare these
    types with the standard type definitions in the Prelude for the
    actual types. I decided to list out the standard data definitions in
    <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT">generalised
    algebraic datatype format</a>.
  </p>
  <pre class="haskell">
data Bool
  = True  :: Bool
  | False :: Bool

newtype Bool' = Bool' { runBool' :: forall a. a -> a -> a }


data Nat
  = Succ :: Nat -> Nat
  | Zero :: Nat

newtype Nat' = Nat' { runNat' :: forall a. (a -> a) -> a -> a }


data List a
  = Cons :: a -> List a -> List a
  | Nil  :: List a

newtype List' a = List'
  { runList' :: forall b. (a -> b -> b) -> b -> b
  }
</code></pre>
  <p>
    And as I did this, I noticed a pattern! If you take the type
    signature of the <code>run</code> function and replace the quantified
    type with the type being declared, you get something very
    interesting.
  </p>
  <pre class="haskell">
Bool' -> Bool' -> Bool'

(Nat' -> Nat') -> Nat' -> Nat'

(a -> List' a -> List' a) -> List' a -> List' a
</code></pre>
  <p>
    In all three cases, the final term is the type itself, and the other
    terms are the types of the data constructors! Go back up and check
    for yourself.
  </p>
  <h2 id="3">
    <a href="#3">The revelation</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    What does this mean? It means that the Church encodings are simply
    abstractions over data constructors! The arguments to the functions
    of the Church encodings should be data constructors! Let’s go back
    and try it for ourself.
  </p>
  <pre class="haskell">
λ runBool' true' True False
True
λ runBool' false' True False
False

λ runNat' zero' (+1) 0
0
λ runNat' (succ' (succ' zero')) (+1) 0
2

λ runList' nil' (:) []
[]
λ runList' (cons' 1 (cons' 2 nil')) (:) []
[1,2]
</code></pre>
  <p>
    And just like all good revelations, now that I see it it seems so
    obvious.
  </p>
  <p>
    So with this knowledge in hand, we can go on to define Church
    encodings for any data type we can think of. Let’s try Haskell’s
    <code>Maybe</code> and <code>Either</code> types, and while we’re at
    it we can use more meaningful identifiers for the lambda terms.
  </p>
  <pre class="haskell">
data Maybe a
  = Just    :: a -> Maybe a
  | Nothing :: Maybe a

newtype Maybe' a = Maybe'
  { runMaybe' :: forall b. (a -> b) -> b -> b
  }

nothing' :: Maybe' a
nothing' = Maybe' $ \just nothing -> nothing

just' :: a -> Maybe' a
just' a = Maybe' $ \just nothing -> just a


data Either a b
  = Left  :: a -> Either a b
  | Right :: b -> Either a b

newtype Either' a b = Either'
  { runEither' :: forall c. (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> c
  }

left' :: a -> Either' a b
left' a = Either' $ \left right -> left a

right' :: b -> Either' a b
right' b = Either' $ \left right -> right b
</code></pre>
