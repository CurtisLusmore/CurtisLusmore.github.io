    A few years ago I was consulting with a service delivery team. They had
    some manual processes for on-boarding new customers that took two weeks and
    they were trying to drive this time down. They knew all the tasks that were
    involved, and they used a spreadsheet to plan it all out.
  </p>
  <p>
    They were trying to switch from this waterfall-ish process to something
    more agile, which of course started with adopting an Enterprise-grade Agile
    tool like Azure Devops. They had 4 on-boarding jobs in the pipeline, so
    they created a backlog and filled it up with eight weeks’ worth of work.
  </p>
  <p>
    They planned the work down to the task-level for each customer. This was
    dozens of tasks all painstakingly fleshed out with descriptions, acceptance
    criteria and estimates, they’d assigned all the work to the appropriate
    people, and they were ready to go. They must have spent a week planning all
    of this.
  </p>
  <p>
    With enough repetition I’m sure they might get the delivery time down a
    bit, but there was no way they’d make significant improvements, to the
    extent that they really wanted, without a drastic change. They knew they
    needed to automate most or all of the process, but that’s not what their
    work plan showed. Before they had even started, they were literally
    planning to do the work the same way four times in a row.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is when I joined. I started by walking them through the principles of
    agile delivery and continuous improvement. We agreed that since our goal
    was to learn and improve with each attempt, that it didn’t make sense to
    plan out the specifics of how the second, third and fourth customers would
    be onboarded. We decided to remove the tasks underneath those stories,
    continue with the current (manual) process for the first customer as
    planned, but do the breakdown for the other stories once we had more
    information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sure enough there were a few tweaks we needed to make through the first
    iteration. There were some gaps in the process that they knew about but
    never bothered to update the tracking spreadsheet, which meant they were
    then blindly copied into the backlog. There were also some unexpected gaps
    in the process because it was recorded wrong, or some workflows had
    changed. Scrapping the sub-tasks was already a win at this stage, because
    we’d already discovered they were wrong.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the second iteration we started automating some steps. It can take
    longer to develop the automation than to just do the thing, so in order to
    honor the two-week timebox for the iteration we used some manual steps
    where automation would take too long. Scrapping the sub-tasks for this
    iteration was a huge win—rather than have the <s>project manager</s>
    iteration manager dictate how the work needs to be performed by
    pre-defining the tasks, we gave the subject-matter experts the autonomy to
    decide for themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the third iteration we automated the remaining steps in the process, so
    that by the end of our two-week sprint timebox we had a fully-automated
    on-boarding pipeline.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fourth iteration took two minutes to run the pipeline.
  </p>
  <p>
    The moral of the story is that in this case, premature work breakdown set
    the team down the wrong path, thinking that they knew today exactly how
    they would perform work two months in the future, despite not knowing what
    they would learn in the meantime. They were essentially planning to not
    learn anything, to not improve.
  </p>
  <p>
    By leaving future work unplanned, you open yourself up to the possibility
    of discovering a better plan tomorrow than you could possibly create
    today.
