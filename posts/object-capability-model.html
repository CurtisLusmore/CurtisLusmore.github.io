  <h1>Object-capability Model</h1>

<section>
  <p>
    The object-capability model is a really interesting model of programming
    that I don’t think is well taught and certainly not well practiced, nor
    even encouraged by most modern programming languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Think about the concrete actions that your application can take: making a
    web request, reading/<wbr>writing to the filesystem, communicating with
    another process like a database, printing to the console, etc. We call
    these “capabilities”, and without them a program is basically useless.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine trying to track down all the places in a code-base where these
    actions could be taken, because you’re trying to trace a bug or you’re
    trying to see what actions a library call might make. In most modern
    programming languages this is really hard. Let’s pick as an example just
    making web requests. You might start by searching for all references to
    <code>HttpClient</code> (or similar class in your preferred language).
  </p>
  <p>
    But what if it uses a different HTTP primitive, like
    <code>HttpWebRequest</code>? Or what if the usage of the primitive is
    hidden inside one of the libraries you import, like a standard client
    library for a particular service, and you don’t have the source code
    available? It’s basically impossible to find everything, even for something
    this important and this ubiquitous.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem is that the “make a web request” capability is available
    statically to every part of your program, or any of its dependencies, via
    public classes like <code>HttpClient</code>. If I’m writing a piece of code
    that needs to make a web request, nothing can stop me from doing it. I
    don’t need to be given permission/<wbr>access to this capability by any
    other part of the application, I don’t need to even declare in any
    discoverable way that I’m using this capability, so that others might be
    aware of my using it. It’s completely unpreventable and untraceable to the
    rest of the program.
  </p>
  <p>
    The way that the object-capability model handles this is to dictate how
    parts of a program can access each capability, and you can use this to
    track usage of a capability across your program. The object-capability
    model defines four ways that part of a program can access a capability:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Initial conditions: The runtime of your program may make certain
        capabilities available to anybody/<wbr>everybody. This can be a global
        capability like most language primitives, or the availability can be
        limited to only parts of the program by classes marked as
        <code>protected</code>, <code>private</code> or <code>internal</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parenthood: If an object A creates another object B, then A usually
        gets a reference to B automatically. This means that A can likely
        access any capability that B can access.
      </li>
      <li>
        Endowment: If an object A creates another object B, then A can pass B
        any/<wbr>all references it wishes, e.g. via the arguments of the
        constructor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Introduction: If an object A has a reference to other objects B and C,
        then A can give B a reference to C via one of B’s methods.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason why it’s so hard to track the “make a web request” capability in
    most modern programming languages is that it’s widely available through
    initial conditions—<wbr>it’s a public class available to the entire
    program.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine instead if the only place that you were able to call the
    <code>HttpClient</code> constructor was in <code>Program.cs</code>, and you
    weren’t able to create subclasses. Basically, imagine if we limited the
    availability of <code>HttpClient</code> via initial conditions to a single
    file.
  </p>
  <p>
    If any other part of our program wants to use <code>HttpClient</code>, it
    would need to use some other mechanism for transferring
    capabilities—<wbr>parenthood, endowment, or introduction. Any library which
    needs a <code>HttpClient</code> would essentially need to request
    permission for one via a constructor or method argument. We could track the
    flow of <code>HttpClient</code>s via constructor and method signatures,
    knowing that they can only possibly originate in <code>Program.cs</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is very similar to how dependency injection and inversion of control
    work in object-oriented programming languages, but we usually only use
    these techniques for our own code—<wbr>the public classes in the language’s
    standard library usually don’t work this way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another key point in the object capability model is that references to
    objects should be unforgeable. Unless an object is given a reference
    through one of the four means above—<wbr>initial conditions, parenthood,
    endowment, or introduction—<wbr>it can’t possibly forge its own copy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most programming languages don’t allow you to forge object references. Some
    do, like how in C you can cast an arbitrary integer to a pointer to obtain
    a reference to an object/<wbr>value. But most languages since C don’t allow
    this.
  </p>
  <p>
    But not all capabilities are objects in your runtime, and not all
    references are object references. Think about access to a database or a web
    service endpoint, which usually have a connection string or a URL. This is
    a reference, but it’s just an ordinary string.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your <code>appsettings.json</code> or <code>web.config</code> file is an
    initial condition for obtaining such a reference to a database or web
    service endpoint, and usually access to these values is limited to
    <code>Startup.cs</code> so you can track the flow of these references via
    constructor and method arguments. From the perspective of the
    object-capability model, this is great news.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately they can also be hard-coded into the program source anywhere,
    or reconstructed from a template and environment name, etc. These
    references are forgeable—<wbr>they break the rules of the object-capability
    model, and make it impossible to track usage of the capability.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why does this all matter? So what if some arbitrary part of my code-base
    can make a web request without my knowledge? What’s the big deal? Well for
    one this could be a security problem if a library you depend on suddenly
    started exfiltrating data because it has full access to your filesystem and
    the internet. This isn’t a hypothetical threat either, something just like
    this happened with the <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180565383195/details-about-the-event-stream-incident"
    >event-stream NPM package</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also makes it really hard to reason about program behaviour when you
    have no way of knowing which parts of your program have access to which
    capabilities. If your program has a bug and you identify the cause to be an
    unwanted call to another service or local process, and there’s no limit to
    which parts of your code-base could be doing this, it’s a lot harder to
    track down the source of the problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    The object-capability model addresses these problems by limiting the ways
    that capabilities can be passed around your application to one of four
    methods: initial conditions, parenthood, endowment, and introduction. By
    further restricting which capabilities are freely available across our
    entire codebase via initial conditions, we can restrict which pieces of
    code can access each capability, track how the capabilities are passed from
    one class to another via constructor or method arguments, and have a better
    understanding of what our program is doing and where.
