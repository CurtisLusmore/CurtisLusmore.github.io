          This site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub
          Pages</a>. Because I’d like to have a rough idea of which of my posts
          are receiving the most engagement and which sites are driving the
          most traffic, and since GitHub Pages doesn’t provide me with this by
          default, I decided to add some page view analytics to my site.
          I’m not particularly keen on privacy-invasive services like Google
          Analytics, which collect far more information than I need and share
          it with 3rd-parties, so I decided to build my own minimalist service.
          Also, it just seemed like a fun yak-shaving exercise, and everything
          else on this page is hand-made.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this post we’ll walk through how to build a very basic page
          analytics service using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/"
          >Azure Functions</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/tables/"
          >Table Storage</a>, which you can host yourself for a few cents per
          year—my last twelve invoices reached a grand total of 49 cents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is this going to be a genuine substitute for Google Analytics?
          Definitely not. It won’t track session flows, time spent on the page,
          conversion, audience details, or anything fancy like that. It’s just
          going to do the absolute basics, which is to record which pages get
          viewed and what the referrer was. For a page which receives as little
          traffic as this website, that’s perfectly adequate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way that it works is that a bit of JavaScript will run on each
          page view of your website, which sends some information (the path of
          the page being viewed, and the referrer) to an Azure Function, which
          then stores these details into Table Storage. You can then query
          Table Storage to see which pages are being viewed and where the
          traffic is coming from.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we get started, you’re going to need to make sure you’ve
          installed the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli"
          >Azure CLI</a>, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local"
          >Azure Functions Core Tools</a>, and the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/"
          >.NET Core CLI</a>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 id="1">
          <a href="#1">Function setup</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Let’s get started by creating our project directory and adding the
          required boilerplate. Open up your favourite terminal and run the
          following commands to create a blank .NET function app.
        </p>
        <pre>
mkdir logger
cd logger
func init --worker-runtime dotnet
</pre>
        <p>
          Next we need to add our function to it, and install the required
          package dependencies.
        </p>
        <pre>
func new --language 'C#' --template HttpTrigger --name Log
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage
</pre>
        <p>
          This will create a <code>Log.cs</code> file containing a standard C#
          function. At this point, you could test the function locally by
          running the following.
        </p>
        <pre>
func host start
</pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 id="2">
          <a href="#2">Function implementation</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first thing we need to add is a class to represent a log entry.
          In Table Storage, each entry must have a <code>PartitionKey</code>
          and a <code>RowKey</code>, which combined must uniquely identify each
          entry. Entries will also automatically have a <code>Timestamp</code>
          property which records the time that they were last modified.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll use the <code>PartitionKey</code> to record the page being
          visited, but unfortunately we can’t use the <code>RowKey</code> to
          record the referrer since this (hopefully) wouldn’t be a unique pair.
          Instead we’ll add a new property, <code>Referrer</code>, and use a
          random GUID to ensure uniqueness of the <code>RowKey</code> property.
          This means that our <code>LogEntry</code> class will look as follows.
        </p>
        <pre>
public class LogEntry
{
    public string PartitionKey { get; set; }
    public string RowKey { get; set; }
    public string Referrer { get; set; }
}
</pre>
        <p>
          Next we need to change the function implementation. I’ll supply the
          full code snippet first and then we’ll walk through it together.
        </p>
        <pre>
[FunctionName("Log")]
[return: Table("LogEntries")]
public static async Task&lt;LogEntry&gt; Run(
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post", Route = null)]
    HttpRequest req,
    ILogger log)
{
    log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

    string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
    dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);

    string location = data?.location;
    string referrer = data?.referrer;

    log.LogInformation($"{location} -> {referrer}");

    return new LogEntry
    {
        PartitionKey = location.Replace("/", "|"), // '/' not supported
        RowKey = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
        Referrer = referrer
    };
}
</pre>
        <p>
          The first change is to add the <code>[return:
          Table("LogEntries")]</code> attribute and change the return type from
          <code>Task&lt;IActionResult&gt;</code> to
          <code>Task&lt;LogEntry&gt;</code>. This allows us to return a new
          entry for the <code>LogEntries</code> table in Table Storage, which
          will be inserted automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next we changed the access level from <code>Function</code> to
          <code>Anonymous</code>, because we’re going to be hitting this
          function from publicly viewable JavaScript where we can’t hide an API
          key anyway, and changed the allowed methods to only allow
          <code>POST</code>, since that’s the method which bests describes our
          action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we changed the body of the function retrieve two properties
          from the body of the request, <code>location</code> and
          <code>referrer</code>, and use them to construct a new
          <code>LogEntry</code> object as described above. Note that we’ve had
          to replace forward-slashes <code>/</code> with vertical-line
          <code>|</code> because the <code>PartitionKey</code> property doesn’t
          support values with forward-slashes. We are expecting the body of
          incoming requests to look something like this.
        </p>
        <pre>
{
  "location": "/posts/diy-page-analytics",
  "referrer": "/posts"
}
</pre>
        <p>
          Putting it all together, we can now send an unauthenticated
          <code>POST</code> request to this function with a body as described
          above, it will pick out the <code>location</code> and
          <code>referrer</code> properties, and add an entry in the
          <code>LogEntries</code> table of Table Storage. “Which Table Storage
          account?”, you might ask. It turns out Azure Functions require a
          Table Storage account already to record function invocations, so when
          you test this locally this will likely be through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator"
          >Azure Storage Emulator</a>, and when running in Azure, it will be a
          Storage Account that we’ll create.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to test this now, you can run the following.
        </p>
        <pre>
func host start --cors '*'
</pre>
        <p>
          You can then use a tool like <a href="https://www.postman.com/"
          >Postman</a> to send a request, and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/"
          >Azure Storage Explorer</a> to verify that the entry is added to
          Table Storage.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 id="3">
          <a href="#3">Updating your website</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Next up we’ll add some JavaScript to your website to trigger the
          Azure Function and send the payload containing the
          <code>location</code> and <code>referrer</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          All you’ll need to do is add the following script somewhere to each
          page, whether that be by adding it to some existing widely used
          script file or creating a new file and including it in the header of
          each page. I’d advise against in-lining it in a script element on
          each page in case you need to change any of the behaviour (especially
          the URL) later.
        </p>
        <pre>
(function () {
  if (navigator.doNotTrack === '1') return;
  const payload = {
    location: document.location.pathname,
    referrer: document.referrer
  };
  fetch(
    'http://localhost:7071/api/Log',
    {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(payload)
    }
  );
}());
</pre>
        <p>
          Let’s step through this. The first step is to check the
          <code>doNotTrack</code> property on the global <code>navigator</code>
          object. This will be set if the user included the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/navigator/doNotTrack"
          >DNT HTTP header</a> in the request, signifying that they do not wish
          to be tracked. We should be respectful of the users’ privacy wishes,
          so if they’ve set DNT then we abort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next we grab the <code>location.pathname</code> property as the
          <code>location</code> and the <code>referrer</code>, and use the
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API"
          >Fetch API</a> to send a <code>POST</code> request to our function.
          Finally, we wrapped all of this in a self-invoking anonymous function
          to avoid polluting the global namespace.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll have to come back and update the URL after we deploy to Azure,
          but for now this should be testable locally.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 id="4">
          <a href="#4">Deploying to Azure</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Now we’re going to deploy our function to Azure using the Azure CLI
          and the Azure Functions Core Tools in PowerShell. As I said above, we
          will use a Function App and Table Storage. The free tier of the
          Function App far exceeds our usage so it will be free, and Table
          Storage has no up-front pricing and very low usage costs, so should
          only cost you a few cents per year. If you’re concerned about cost, I
          would suggest putting a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/tutorial-acm-create-budgets"
          >budget alert</a> on the resource group we create. I added one for 5c
          per month and it’s only notified me once.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first step is to log in to your Azure account and set the default
          subscription. When you log in, you’ll see a list of available
          subscriptions, so grab the ID of the one you want to use.
        </p>
        <pre>
az login
az account set --subscription 'your-subscription-id'
</pre>
          <p>
            Next we will set a few variables for values that we’ll need to use
            several times throughout the process.
          </p>
          <pre>
$location = 'australiasoutheast'
$rg = 'resource-group-name'
$sa = 'storageaccountname'
$fa = 'function-app-name'
</pre>
          <p>
            You’ll need to supply globally unique values for the Storage
            Account name and the Function App name, noting that Storage Account
            names must be 3-24 characters using only lower-case letters and
            digits, and Function App names can’t use special characters other
            than hyphens. You can pick whichever location you prefer—I’ve gone
            with the data center in Melbourne. You can use the following
            command to get a list of available locations, and you’ll need to
            grab the value for the <code>Name</code> property.
          </p>
          <pre>
az account list-locations --out table
</pre>
          <p>
            Next we will create the resource group, the Storage Account and the
            Function App.
          </p>
          <pre>
az group create `
    --name $rg `
    --location $location

az storage account create `
    --name $sa `
    --location $location `
    --resource-group $rg `
    --sku STANDARD_LRS

az functionapp create `
    --name $fa `
    --resource-group $rg `
    --storage-account $sa `
    --consumption-plan-location $location
</pre>
          <p>
            Finally we need to configure <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">
            CORS</a> for our Function App, and then deploy the function we
            created earlier.
          </p>
          <pre>
az functionapp cors add `
    --name $fa `
    --resource-group $rg `
    --allowed-origins https://your-website.com http://localhost:8080

func azure functionapp publish $fa
</pre>
        <p>
          It’s up to you whether you want to allow CORS from
          <code>localhost</code>. It will come in handy while testing to make
          sure you’ve set everything up correctly, but you might find it floods
          your logs while you’re testing content changes on your website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your function should now be live and running at
          <code>https://$fa.azurewebsites.net/api/Log</code>, based on your
          choice of the Function App name. Don’t forget to substitute this back
          into the JavaScript snippet on your website.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, you might want to add a custom domain to your
          Function App. This is also completely free, and you can do this by
          following the instructions to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain"
          >add a Custom Domain</a> and then <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate#create-a-free-certificate-preview"
          >create a free certificate</a>. If you do this, don’t forget again to
          substitute the new URL back into the JavaScript snippet on your
          website.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 id="5">
          <a href="#5">Querying the logs</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          At this point your website should be set up and collecting page view
          records to Table Storage, and now you want to run queries on your
          data.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can browse the records directly in the <a href="portal.azure.com/"
          >Azure Portal</a> or via Azure Storage Explorer, or you can use the
          Azure CLI to retrieve the entries programmatically. The following
          command will fetch all entries for the last month and hydrate them as
          PowerShell objects.
        </p>
        <pre>
$time = [DateTime]::UtcNow.AddDays(-7).ToString("o")
$logs = az storage entity query `
    --account-name $sa `
    --table-name LogEntries `
    --filter "Timestamp ge datetime'$time'" `
    | ConvertFrom-Json `
    | Select-Object -ExpandProperty items
        </pre>
        <p>
          We can then group by <code>location</code>
          (<code>PartitionKey</code>) or <code>referrer</code> to see which
          pages get the most hits and what drives the most traffic, for
          example, using the following two commands.
        </p>
        <pre>
$logs `
    | Group-Object -Property PartitionKey `
    | Select-Object -Property Count,Name `
    | Sort-Object -Property Count -Descending
$logs `
    | Group-Object -Property Referrer `
    | Select-Object -Property Count,Name `
    | Sort-Object -Property Count -Descending
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 id="6">
          <a href="#6">Wrap-up</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you’ve made it to the end, you should now have your very own basic
          analytics service running in Azure which records page views with the
          referrer, and your website hooked up to use it. Depending on your
          needs you could look at expanding the payload to include other basic
          details you care about, like screen size, but for any complex
          requirements, honestly this is not going to be the right tool for
          you.
        </p>
        <p>I’ve been using it on this website for over a year now, I have
          never had to do any maintenance or code changes, and it has cost me
          around 50 cents in total to operate. But more importantly, it was fun
          to build, I get some small feeling of satisfaction in knowing that
          this website remains 100% hand-made, and I learnt about the basics of
          Azure Functions and Table Storage in the process.
