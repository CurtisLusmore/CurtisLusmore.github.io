    In my day job I’m a software development consultant, which means I work in
    a delivery team and spend a great deal of time working closely with my
    product owner to build great software. Outside of my day job, I was
    recently part of a big project completely unrelated to software and was on
    the other side of the fence, as the (co-) product owner working with a
    rather different type of delivery team.
  </p>
  <p>
    It has been a huge learning experience for me, not just getting the product
    owner’s perspective but also observing how delivery teams work in other
    industries. In this post I’ll share some of the most important lessons
    which I think we can carry across to software development.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ll start with a quick overview of the project. It started with a roughly
    forty-week development phase, then a very intense production deployment,
    and continues now with an ongoing development-in-production phase.
  </p>
  <p>
    The “product” is my son, delivered in September last year.
  </p>
  <p>
    The biggest lesson has been a pretty significant rethink of project scope,
    must-haves and nice-to-haves. It turns out the list of must-haves is much
    smaller than the feature list of a typical adult human, basically just
    breathing, feeding, sleeping, and waste disposal, with a fairly primitive
    alerting system which doesn’t even really distinguish between which of the
    above four functions has an issue.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ability to walk and talk are two of the most critical skills for
    humans—<wbr>what I would generally consider as must-haves—<wbr>but my son
    wasn’t born with either of these features and even now at seven months of
    age they’re still a while off. There are good reasons that these features
    are deferred until after the production deployment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Firstly, they take a long time to develop, and technically you can survive
    without them, so insisting they be ready for the initial deployment really
    only serves to delay the initial deployment (not a pleasant thought for my
    wife). But secondly and more importantly, they would be too hard or likely
    impossible to develop well without a feedback loop, which is the next big
    lesson.
  </p>
  <p>
    Real feedback loops are critically important to developing most features.
    The processes required to walk and talk are just far too complicated to be
    developed in isolation without the assistance of good feedback mechanisms.
    They take hours and hours of repetitive trial-and-error to fine-tune, and
    no amount of deep thought, design or planning will be an adequate
    substitute for this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note also that I said <em>real</em> feedback loops. Many development teams
    will use lower environments to test and iterate on features, and this is
    certainly better than no feedback loop at all, but sometimes there really
    is just nothing like production and no tester like a real user. You can
    still do this in a controlled way without releasing untested features to
    the entire world, through techniques like feature flags and deployment
    rings.
  </p>
  <p>
    My son can practice his walking and talking safely at home before he
    progresses to the outside world, but even then, as the saying goes, “you
    have to crawl before you can walk”, which brings us to the third big
    lesson.
  </p>
  <p>
    Iterative development can mean delivering temporary, interim features that
    won’t be needed in the long-term. When time is short and you’re already
    being ruthless with your must-haves and nice-to-haves, developing features
    that will be removed or replaced later can seem like a waste of time. But
    some features are just too big to implement in one piece—<wbr>whether that
    be within a release or a sprint—<wbr>and it makes sense to instead
    implement a smaller or simpler feature that will start the feedback loop
    sooner.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can then iterate from this interim solution by changing or extending
    where possible, or at least by applying lessons learnt from the feedback
    loop to deliver with more confidence. There’s another saying for this,
    “make it work, make it right, make it fast”.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fourth lesson was about staying flexible and adapting to change. So
    much of what happens, before and after the birth, is out of your hands.
    It’s good to have a plan, but it’s better to have a plan that’s flexible.
    You are encouraged to decide on a birth plan, but anything can happen on
    the day so you need to be ready to adapt. Similarly with all of the various
    clothes and supplies you need to by—<wbr>we found it was best to buy
    conservatively at first, see what works and what we like, and then buy more
    as needed. It’s hard to know what you need to pack in your nappy bag until
    you need it, so the contents change over time as you encounter more
    scenarios.
  </p>
  <p>
    One lever you can use to help adjust to change is the length of your
    feedback cycle, like your sprint length. Early on in the pregnancy when
    things develop slowly, we would only see our obstetrician once per month.
    This eventually increased to once per fortnight, once per week and then
    several times per week right before the delivery, as things began to change
    faster and faster. After the birth you have regular visits with a maternal
    and child health nurse. The frequency of these visits follows the opposite
    pattern, from once a fortnight, once a month, to once every several months,
    as development starts to stabilise and slow down.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some things just can’t be planned at all. Even ignoring the ethics of it,
    it would be foolish of me to try to plan out my child’s hobbies and
    interests. For some things, it’s best to just provide a lot of
    opportunities for experimentation and then invest further in the things
    that work.
  </p>
  <p>
    The fifth lesson was on conducting effective handovers. In consulting its
    quite common for the delivery team to hand the application over to another
    team at the end of the project, like an in-house development or operations
    team, but this can also happen at product companies where a development
    team hands an application off to an operations team. This usually involves
    some amount of documentation and a knowledge transfer workshop.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve never found this format to be particularly effective, as it’s
    extremely difficult for somebody with no context of an application to know
    what questions to ask or which points to pay particular attention to.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the delivery of my son, my wife and I stayed at the hospital for four
    nights and were the primary carers, but we had 24/7 access to a team of
    midwives and nurses who walked us through everything we needed to learn and
    could be called upon at any time to assist. Four days is long enough that
    you’ll need to run through the main processes (feeding, nappy changes,
    putting to sleep, bathing) several times, and will need to diagnose a few
    outbreaks of crying. This means that the handover doesn’t end until you
    have demonstrated the ability to manage on your own.
  </p>
  <p>
    I always think it’s worthwhile looking to other industries to see what
    lessons can be applied to software development. Many of the problems we
    face are more universal than you’d think, and it’s interesting to see the
    approaches others have found to dealing with them. As you deal with other
    professions in your day-to-day life, keep an eye out for things you can
    learn from them.
