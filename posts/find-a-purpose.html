    This is the second part in a series describing my journey as a
    programmer. If you haven’t already, please read Part 1,
    <a href="/posts/the-first-great-epiphany">The First Great
    Epiphany</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I continued building tiny, incomplete games with Game Maker for a
    couple of years, never really making anything substantial but still
    learning a lot. And while I was enjoying the act of making games, and
    I certainly enjoyed playing games, I didn’t really enjoy playing my
    games. Partly because they weren’t very good, but also because I knew
    how they worked, how to beat them, and I didn’t get the same feeling
    of discovery that I got playing other games. And as the enjoyment of
    playing the games diminished, so too did the enjoyment of making
    them. I wasn’t sure whether I should be programming for the sake of
    programming, or programming for the outcome.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, I was spending a great deal of time playing an
    online game, which will remain nameless. The client for playing this
    game had an IRC chat window below the main game window, which I would
    use to chat with my friends while playing. One of my friends was also
    a programmer, and he knew how to make IRC bots. If I recall
    correctly, his bot simply helped administer the channel—it would
    grant certain users permissions when they joined, kick people out
    when they broke the rules, it could even run a little trivia game. It
    didn’t do anything terribly exciting, but I could see the potential.
  </p>
  <p>
    So over the next few weeks and months, my friend taught me how to
    write IRC bots. I honestly can’t remember at all now what language I
    was writing in, at the time I wasn’t even really aware of
    general-purpose programming languages so I didn’t really care. I just
    saw it as an advanced feature of the IRC client that would let me do
    all sorts of interesting stuff when things happened in the channel.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started out with really basic features—I got it to repeat back
    anything you said in the channel, like an echo. This gets old really
    quickly though, so I tweaked it a little. If you sent it a private
    message, it would echo it back to the channel, so you could message
    the channel anonymously. As you can imagine in a chat room full of
    young teens, that feature was pretty popular for a while. But it
    wasn’t much of a challenge for me to have written. I knew a decent
    amount of programming fundamentals from my time making games, so I
    knew what my bot could be capable of, I just needed to re-learn how
    to do it in this new language.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the great things about building a bot in a multiplayer game is
    that you have a ready-made group of users. People to show off your
    work to, to enjoy it with, to give you feedback and suggestions. Over
    time I added a bunch of features that gave you information about the
    game we were all playing—you could ask it for details of a quest, or
    for the level and skills of another player, and it would look it up
    and post the answer into the channel. The most ridiculous feature I
    added was to make it record all of the questions and answers from my
    friend’s bot’s trivia game, and jump in with any answer it had seen
    before. Soon enough it knew all the questions and answers and
    completely dominated the trivia game, it would answer in only a few
    milliseconds.
  </p>
  <p>
    I finally started learning programming in a formal setting in my last
    few years of high school, where I took a class teaching Visual Basic.
    Visual Basic is a general-purpose programming language, and I could
    finally use it to program outside the context of some specific
    environment, to make anything I wanted. But I never really got around
    to doing anything with it outside of class—my spare programming
    energy was going into something much more stupid than that.
  </p>
  <p>
    For our mathematics classes, we had programmable calculators. The
    calculator came with a full reference manual for the programming
    language it supported, so it didn’t take long before I read the whole
    thing and started making programs and sharing them with my friends.
    Some of the programs were silly games, but the more advanced ones
    would not only solve some types of homework problems but even
    generate all of the required working as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    So why the hell—when I could be programming in a real language like
    Visual Basic creating interesting programs with GUIs—was I wasting my
    time programming my calculator? Because I could carry it around with
    me all day at school (remember this was before smartphones, tablets
    and affordable laptops), and all my friends had one that they carried
    with them every day as well. Just like with my IRC bot, I was not
    just enjoying the act of programming, but also using the thing I was
    building.
  </p>
  <p>
    Especially for people getting started with programming, it’s really
    important to find a purpose—the reason you’re doing it. This is what
    will give you the drive to continue when it gets too hard, or too
    tedious. For me, it’s building things that I can use, and building
    things that help me to think about something in a new way. Hell, even
    this blog is really just a way for me to flesh out thoughts that
    would otherwise float aimlessly in the back of my head.
