          This is the second part in a series describing my journey as a
          programmer. If you haven’t already, please read Part 1,
          <a href="/posts/the-first-great-epiphany">The First Great
          Epiphany</a>.

          I continued building tiny, incomplete games with Game Maker for a
          couple of years, never really making anything substantial but still
          learning a lot. And while I was enjoying the act of making games, and
          I certainly enjoyed playing games, I didn’t really enjoy playing my
          games. Partly because they weren’t very good, but also because I knew
          how they worked, how to beat them, and I didn’t get the same feeling
          of discovery that I got playing other games. And as the enjoyment of
          playing the games diminished, so too did the enjoyment of making
          them. I wasn’t sure whether I should be programming for the sake of
          programming, or programming for the outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, I was spending a great deal of time playing an
          online game, which will remain nameless. The client for playing this
          game had an IRC chat window below the main game window, which I would
          use to chat with my friends while playing. One of my friends was also
          a programmer, and he knew how to make IRC bots. If I recall
          correctly, his bot simply helped administer the channel—it would
          grant certain users permissions when they joined, kick people out
          when they broke the rules, it could even run a little trivia game. It
          didn’t do anything terribly exciting, but I could see the potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          So over the next few weeks and months, my friend taught me how to
          write IRC bots. I honestly can’t remember at all now what language I
          was writing in, at the time I wasn’t even really aware of
          general-purpose programming languages so I didn’t really care. I just
          saw it as an advanced feature of the IRC client that would let me do
          all sorts of interesting stuff when things happened in the channel.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started out with really basic features—I got it to repeat back
          anything you said in the channel, like an echo. This gets old really
          quickly though, so I tweaked it a little. If you sent it a private
          message, it would echo it back to the channel, so you could message
          the channel anonymously. As you can imagine in a chat room full of
          young teens, that feature was pretty popular for a while. But it
          wasn’t much of a challenge for me to have written. I knew a decent
          amount of programming fundamentals from my time making games, so I
          knew what my bot could be capable of, I just needed to re-learn how
          to do it in this new language.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the great things about building a bot in a multiplayer game is
          that you have a ready-made group of users. People to show off your
          work to, to enjoy it with, to give you feedback and suggestions. Over
          time I added a bunch of features that gave you information about the
          game we were all playing—you could ask it for details of a quest, or
          for the level and skills of another player, and it would look it up
          and post the answer into the channel. The most ridiculous feature I
          added was to make it record all of the questions and answers from my
          friend’s bot’s trivia game, and jump in with any answer it had seen
          before. Soon enough it knew all the questions and answers and
          completely dominated the trivia game, it would answer in only a few
          milliseconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          I finally started learning programming in a formal setting in my last
          few years of high school, where I took a class teaching Visual Basic.
          Visual Basic is a general-purpose programming language, and I could
          finally use it to program outside the context of some specific
          environment, to make anything I wanted. But I never really got around
          to doing anything with it outside of class—my spare programming
          energy was going into something much more stupid than that.
        </p>
        <p>
          For our mathematics classes, we had programmable calculators. The
          calculator came with a full reference manual for the programming
          language it supported, so it didn’t take long before I read the whole
          thing and started making programs and sharing them with my friends.
          Some of the programs were silly games, but the more advanced ones
          would not only solve some types of homework problems but even
          generate all of the required working as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          So why the hell—when I could be programming in a real language like
          Visual Basic creating interesting programs with GUIs—was I wasting my
          time programming my calculator? Because I could carry it around with
          me all day at school (remember this was before smartphones, tablets
          and affordable laptops), and all my friends had one that they carried
          with them every day as well. Just like with my IRC bot, I was not
          just enjoying the act of programming, but also using the thing I was
          building.
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially for people getting started with programming, it’s really
          important to find a purpose—the reason you’re doing it. This is what
          will give you the drive to continue when it gets too hard, or too
          tedious. For me, it’s building things that I can use, and building
          things that help me to think about something in a new way. Hell, even
          this blog is really just a way for me to flesh out thoughts that
          would otherwise float aimlessly in the back of my head.
