                My first exposure to programming was some time around the turn of the
                century with a program called Game Maker, which as the name suggests,
                was built for making games. Game Maker actually supported a decent
                amount of graphical programming by dragging-and-dropping icons around
                the screen to describe the behaviour of different objects in the
                game, but as soon as I learnt that there was another way to do it
                that had more features, I wanted to learn that.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tutorial for the scripting language in Game Maker at the time
                walked you through programming a little game similar to Space
                Invaders, where you controlled a space ship at the bottom of the
                screen and the goal was to shoot the enemy ships approaching from the
                top of the screen. I followed the instructions closely, typing in all
                the code it supplied to define the behaviour for moving and shooting,
                including a cooldown for the gun so that you wouldn’t just fire off
                a shot every game tick. And then they gave you an exercise, to add a
                second weapon to the ship that was triggered from a separate key and
                that had its own cooldown. And I was stumped.

            <h1>Multiple Git Profiles</h1>
          </header>
          <section>
            <p>
              If like me, you need to make Git commits from multiple email
              addresses on the same machine (say, from your personal and your work
              address), here’s a handy trick that will help make sure you make
              every commit with the right address.
            </p>
            <p>
              Start by creating a directory for each profile, named after the
              profile. In my case, I have <code>D:/git/home</code> and
              <code>D:/git/work</code>. Move all your Git repositories into
              the directory corresponding to the profile that you want to use when
              making commits to that repository. At the root of your profile
              directories, create a <code>.gitconfig</code> file with the following
              content.

            <p>
              This is a technique that I discovered several years ago while
              teaching an introductory programming course, and I was extremely
              pleased to find out that although it had already been discovered, I
              had given it the same name. <a target="_blank"
              href="http://dsoguy.blogspot.com/2007/01/programming-by-wishful-thinking.html">
              Programming by wishful thinking</a> is a style of top-down
              program design that helps you improve the structure of your code,
              isolate the hairy parts from the simple parts, think more clearly
              about data flow, and work faster. I find it particularly helpful for
              novice programmers who feel intimidated when starting a new project
              and aren’t sure how to get started, but I still practise it regularly
              as well.

            <h1>Diagnostics Anonymous</h1>
          </header>
          <section>
            <p>
              When working with large systems, especially with software, inevitably
              something will go wrong and you’ll be stuck trying to diagnose it.
              My years of developing software have given me a lot of practice
              diagnosing errors or unintended behaviour in software systems
              (usually in my own code), and over time I’ve built up a systematic
              process that I run through to speed up the process. In writing this
              post, I came to realise that my process actually has quite a lot in
              common with 12-step programs, so I’ve tweaked the format a little to
              make the content a little more interesting.

            <p>
              In this post, we are going to explore how you might imitate classes
              in a language that doesn’t have them, to get a better feel for how
              various object-oriented language features actually work. We will use
              JavaScript, but ban ourselves from using
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>the class keyword (obviously),</li>
              <li>the new keyword (we will construct all of our own objects),</li>
              <li>the this keyword,</li>

            <p>
              One of my great joys when designing things is when I discover that I
              can lift a restriction and make something both simpler and more
              powerful at the same time. This can happen at all levels, from
              something like changing a function signature to make it more generic,
              right up to unifying high level system components. The more generic
              something is, the more situations you can use it in, and the more
              value it can provide.

            <h2>What’s the purpose of a programming language?</h2>
            <p>
              A programming language is an interface between humans and computers,
              that allows us to program computers to perform some task. The purpose
              of the task is usually to solve some particular problem that the
              human has. Most languages are <a target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing
              complete</a>, which essentially means that they are mostly all
              equivalent. So what’s the point of creating a new programming
              language if it’s equivalent to ones that already exist? Turing
              completeness means that languages are equivalent in terms of the
              programs they are able to express, but it says nothing about the
              journey of getting to the finished program.

            <h1>199 Days of Git</h1>
            <p>Reflections on Git streaking</p>
          </header>
          <section>
            <p>
              May 20, 2016. My Git streak comes to an abrupt end on 199 days.
              Today, GitHub disabled the commit streak feature and left me stranded
              one day short of a milestone. It feels a little frustrating to get so
              close and then have it taken away, but in the end the overwhelming
              feeling is actually one of relief.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m a chronic procrastinator and a prolific sidetracker—I’ve always
              had trouble following through on things after the initial whirl of
              enthusiastic development dies down. More often than not, it’s not so
              much that I get bored of the project I’m working, it’s that I get
              distracted by something else more exciting. I’ve tried lots of
              different approaches to improve this, but haven’t had much success.

              This phrase is part of the C philosophy, and has influenced the
              design of many programming languages. In general C usage, this is
              best observed by the use of pointer casts—a mechanism by which the
              programmer can bypass the type system, trading compile-time type
              safety for flexibility and potentially incurring fatal crashes at
              run-time. The phrase needs little explanation—the programmer knows
              what they’re doing, don’t get in their way.

            <h1>Why Static Isn’t Real Sharing</h1>
          </header>
          <section>
            <p>
              The static keyword has origins as far back as C, and has carried
              across to C++, Java and C#, among others—although its meaning has
              changed a bit along the way. In C# and Java, one of the common uses
              is for class-level sharing of members. Static members don’t belong to
              any instance, and can only be accessed directly from the class or
              from another definition in the same class.
            </p>
            <p>
              And this is all well and good for sharing within a class, but the
              problem is that it doesn’t play well with inheritance, because static
              members cannot be overridden. And inheritance is another common
              method of achieving code sharing. Consider the following snippet,
              which shows how one might hope to override static members in C#.

            <h1>Intuition of Church Encoding</h1>
          </header>
          <section>
            <p>
              After first being introduced to the concept of Church numerals in
              <a target="_blank" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure
              and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, I decided to learn more
              about them and the more general topic, <a target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church
              encoding</a>. For those who don’t know, Church encoding defines a way
              to represent common data types and structures in the
              <a target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda
              calculus</a> using only functions, since functions are the only terms
              available.
            </p>
            <p>
              I eventually stumbled upon a pretty neat intuition for how Church
              encodings work, which enables you to create encodings for arbitrary
              data types very easily. But first, a little on how I got there…

              I whipped up the following script for running a preprocessor over a
              file at import-time. In most cases, I would say this is far from a
              good idea, but it might be useful for creating small domain-specific
              languages, or defining new literals, or something like that.

              I recently read <a target="_blank"
              href="https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/functional-programming-python.pdf">
              Functional Programming in Python</a> which mentions a library which
              adds multiple dispatch to Python. One of my biggest hobbies is
              creating things from scratch, as it really helps me get a better
              understanding of how they work, so I thought I’d see if I couldn’t
              figure out how to do it myself.

              What’s the best/easiest programming language to learn for a beginner?
              I see this question asked all the time. Usually asked by people who
              want to get into programming, or maybe they’ve just finished learning
              the basics in their first language and are thinking about where to go
              next. It’s an innocent enough question and usually asked with good
              intentions, but it still bugs me every time I see it.
