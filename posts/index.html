    I’ve seen a lot of questions recently about code review, so I thought I
    would write about my experiences working across a few development teams.
    But first, it’s important to remember that code review is but one small
    part of a good development process. It’s hard to give advice in general
    about code review without considering the whole process.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, some people argue that code review is a waste of time because
    by the time you review code, it’s already too late to change the design.
    The author and reviewer will argue for a bit, but by the sunk-cost fallacy
    the author will only commit to minor changes and move on. Some complain
    that code review mostly devolves into petty bike-shedding over code style
    and formatting. Some complain that waiting for review becomes a huge
    bottleneck in the development process.

    A few years ago I came across this awesome post,
    <a href="https://medium.com/intigriti/how-i-hacked-hundreds-of-companies-through-their-helpdesk-b7680ddc2d4c"
    >How I hacked hundreds of companies through their helpdesk</a>, which
    describes a neat hack on a whole bunch of companies. I encourage you to
    read the full post because it’s a fascinating read, but I’ll summarise the
    gist of it here.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some work apps, the most common example being Slack, allow you to register
    and sign in with any email address on your employer’s domain, e.g.
    anything@<wbr>company.com. This is a convenience that allows your employees
    to self-service register without allowing just anybody in. This sounds safe
    enough to a lot of companies, because they figure they only give out these
    email addresses to current employees.

    The footy is back on again, and I was thinking about what lessons we can
    take from team sports, like the AFL, and apply to team environments at work,
    like a typical software development team. So in no particular order, here
    are ten lessons I think that we in software development could learn from
    AFL teams.

    A few years ago I was consulting with a service delivery team. They had
    some manual processes for on-boarding new customers that took two weeks and
    they were trying to drive this time down. They knew all the tasks that were
    involved, and they used a spreadsheet to plan it all out.
  </p>
  <p>
    They were trying to switch from this waterfall-ish process to something
    more agile, which of course started with adopting an Enterprise-grade Agile
    tool like Azure Devops. They had 4 on-boarding jobs in the pipeline, so
    they created a backlog and filled it up with eight weeks’ worth of work.

    Early last year, before COVID, I joined an initiative in my squad at work
    to boost employee engagement. There were four of us in the group and we
    were each tasked with running a series of events for the members of our
    squad. I volunteered to organise a monthly lunch-and-learn session at the
    office, where each month a member of our squad would present on a topic of
    their choosing during our lunch break.
  </p>
  <p>
    We already had these going on an ad-hoc basis sporadically throughout the
    year, usually individually organised by the speaker, but I wanted to make
    this a regular event at the office. Unfortunately lockdown struck before we
    could run the first session, and so we had to change plans. With everybody
    working from home employee engagement felt more important than ever, so we
    quickly pivoted to online sessions and we decided to temporarily up the
    frequency from monthly to weekly, at least for as long as momentum could
    carry us.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then we’ve continued to run these weekly, having just passed 40
    sessions, and having missed only a handful of weeks due to holidays or
    clashes with all-hands. Here’s my top 10 tips for you to try this at your
    work.

    The object-capability model is a really interesting model of programming
    that I don’t think is well taught and certainly not well practiced, nor
    even encouraged by most modern programming languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Think about the concrete actions that your application can take: making a
    web request, reading/writing to the filesystem, communicating with another
    process like a database, printing to the console, etc. We call these
    “capabilities”, and without them a program is basically useless.

    I like to look at the world around me in layers of hierarchy, and there are
    two lenses that I apply when thinking about how these layers come together.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first lens, “top-down”, looks at the world by starting at the top,
    something high-level or abstract, and then working down to the lower
    layers. The second lens, “bottom-up”, is the opposite—starting with
    something low-level or concrete and working up. This sounds pretty
    vague, but you can apply these two lenses to pretty much everything, so
    let’s explore by looking at a few examples.

    In the tech world, the common wisdom is that when things go wrong we have
    blameless post-mortems. The idea here is that preventing the triggering
    event from occurring is only part of the solution. The other part, often
    the bigger part, is mitigating other factors which cause the event to have
    such a large impact. Sometimes it’s not possible to prevent all triggering
    events, and we can improve our resilience and reliability more effectively
    by mitigating common contributing factors to outages.
  </p>
  <p>
    We ask questions like, “Can we detect the triggering event sooner?” “Can we
    speed up our response process?”  “Can we limit the number of people
    impacted, or the degree to which they are impacted?” “Can we automate an
    error-prone manual process?” “Can we allow a system to self-correct?”

    There’s an expression in tech that I think is often misunderstood and then
    used to justify bad behaviour—“fail fast, fail early”. The idea behind it
    is that if an idea is going to fail, it’s better if it fails early, before
    you reach the point of the sunk-cost fallacy.
  </p>
  <p>
    This sounds sensible, and encourages people to <a
    href="/posts/minimum-viewable-program">build a Pilot rather than a Season
    1</a>, which I think is generally a good thing. But I have two major
    concerns with this expression.

    I was working on a Scrum project where the user stories always ended up
    being too big to fit into a sprint, and we were constantly half-finishing
    stories and carrying them over to the next sprint. Our team agreed we
    needed to split the stories up, but we couldn’t agree how.
  </p>
  <p>
    The team proposed we split stories into front-end and back-end components.
    This is a common way of splitting up work, because it’s obvious, it’s easy
    to do, and it’s easy to then assign the smaller stories to those with the
    right skills. I proposed instead we use vertical story slicing, where you
    slice stories into thin, end-to-end slices, and each slice is fully
    integrated and useful to a user. Vertical story slicing could be a post in
    its own right, and I won’t go into a full discussion of its merits here.

    The term MVP, Minimum Viable Product, gets thrown around a lot in our
    industry. Some people say MVPs are too small and customer expectations
    are higher than ever, and propose instead the Minimum Awesome Product.
    Others say MVPs are too big and bloated and still cost too much.
  </p>
  <p>
    To help people agree on the size and scope of an MVP, I propose the
    following simple analogy: Is your MVP a Season 1, or a Pilot? And to
    match, an alternative expansion of MVP: Minimum Viewable Program.

    This site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub
    Pages</a>. Because I’d like to have a rough idea of which of my posts
    are receiving the most engagement and which sites are driving the
    most traffic, and since GitHub Pages doesn’t provide me with this by
    default, I decided to add some page view analytics to my site.
    I’m not particularly keen on privacy-invasive services like Google
    Analytics, which collect far more information than I need and share
    it with 3rd-parties, so I decided to build my own minimalist service.
    Also, it just seemed like a fun yak-shaving exercise, and everything
    else on this page is hand-made.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this post we’ll walk through how to build a very basic page
    analytics service using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/"
    >Azure Functions</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/tables/"
    >Table Storage</a>, which you can host yourself for a few cents per
    year—my last twelve invoices reached a grand total of 49 cents.

  <h1>Goldilocks Routines</h1>

    I hate the lock on my front door. It’s pretty standard. Unlock with a
    key from the outside, lock by turning the knob on the inside. Open
    from the inside and the door stays locked. Seems pretty simple, so
    what’s not to like? If I was capable of following the routine
    perfectly, it wouldn’t be so bad. When I get home I unlock the door,
    step inside, turn the knob to lock the door, and put my keys down on
    my desk. When I leave home I grab my keys from my desk, open the
    door, step outside, and the door stays locked behind me.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem is that I don’t always follow the routine perfectly. I
    can be a forgetful person, and I don’t want to lock myself out by
    leaving the house having forgotten my keys. I know that if I’m
    leaving for work I’ll never forget to take my bag, so sometimes when
    I get home I put my keys in my bag instead of on my desk. But at the
    same time, I don’t want to train myself to think “I will never forget
    my keys because they’re always in my bag”, because sometimes I leave
    the house without my bag, if it’s not for work. This means that every
    time I leave the house, I do the dance where I step outside, keep the
    door propped open with my foot, and then double-check my bag or
    pockets for my keys.

    We make a lot of decisions in software development. Compared to other
    fields of engineering, the process of building software relative to
    designing it is very rapid, shrinking the time between decisions and
    also typically shrinking the time spent on decisions. Modern agile
    software development methodology only exacerbates this problem. “Move
    fast and break things”.
  </p>
  <p>
    On top of this, software systems will often stay under active
    development for decades, growing to be unfathomably large and
    complex. In complex systems decisions in one area often have
    implications in other seemingly unrelated areas, making us hesitant
    to make quick decisions.

    This is an expression originally used to describe a process for
    writing code. Make it work—get something, anything, running as
    quickly as possible. Make it right—get the program to do what you
    want it to. Make it fast—get the program to do what you want it to
    fast enough for your needs. What’s important here is the order. If
    you do these in the wrong order, you’re gonna have a bad time. The
    easiest time to make code compile and run is when there’s barely any
    of it and it doesn’t really matter what it does. It’s really hard to
    fix bugs in tightly optimised code, because it’s likely a lot more
    complicated than it was before you optimised it.

    Whenever I interview for a job at a company, there’s one question
    that I make sure to ask every single person I can.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      What’s the one thing you would miss the most if you left
      $COMPANY_NAME?
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    When I interviewed at <a href="https://readify.net">Readify</a>,
    everybody said it was the people. Not in the “these people are my
    best friends” sense, although that may very well be the case, but
    more importantly in the “this is the smartest, most passionate,
    most supportive, most inspiring bunch of people I’ve ever worked
    with” sense. Seeing a handful of Readifarians present at
    <a href="https://www.dddbrisbane.com/">DDD Brisbane</a> in 2017
    is what attracted me to Readify in the first place, so I had a
    strong feeling this was going to be a common answer when I was
    asking the question.

    In my time so far working in software development, as a developer
    and as a product manager, I’ve made and seen a lot of mistakes. I
    spent some time recently reflecting on some of the biggest
    mistakes, the ones that ultimately cost the most time or money,
    that caused the most frustration and heartache, and tried to
    devise some lessons learnt. In the end I realised that the vast
    majority of mistakes were actually variants of the same core
    mistake, and that one main lesson applied to all of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this post I will discuss this mistake, some examples of where
    it comes up in software development, some thoughts on why it
    keeps happening, and some tips on how to avoid it.

    What do a junior and a senior developer have in common? They both
    constantly feel like they have absolutely no idea what they’re
    doing. What’s the difference between a junior and a senior
    developer? The senior developer knows that this is completely
    normal. One of the things about programming is that if you’re
    doing something you’ve done before, you’re usually doing it
    wrong. And by this I mean that if you’re trying to solve a
    problem you’ve solved before, you should just reuse the solution
    from last time.
  </p>
  <p>
    We’re lucky in the world of software that we can do this, but one
    of the consequences of this is that most software development is

    at least by you. If you work in software, you’d better get used
    to this feeling. It’s easy to look at all the people around you
    at work or in the community and the great work that they do and
    think they must know what they’re doing. “These people are real
    developers, I’m just an impostor. One day they’ll all realise I
    am completely out of my depth and I’ll be fired.” This feeling is
    so common that it has a name—<a

    What is computer science really about? In the present day,
    despite being such a relatively young and immature field,
    computer science employs millions of people all over the world,
    it produces the technologies that run our lives, and it is
    responsible for countless billions or trillions of dollars of
    value. Even going into the near-term future, the software that
    has been built over the last few decades will continue to affect
    the daily lives of people for generations to come.
  </p>
  <p>
    But to me, that’s just commercial success. At the end of the day,
    or perhaps better to say at the end of the millenium, will
    anybody really care? If we made contact with an alien race, would
    we brag about our ability to share cat photos with millions of
    strangers, or even our ability to build billion dollar companies?
    There must be some deeper meaning to this all. I can feel it.
    When I’m programming or problem solving, I feel like I’m
    exploring. But what am I exploring?

    Today marks the 18th anniversary of the final day of the meeting
    at Snowbird which ultimately lead to the creation of the
    <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile software development
    manifesto</a>. If it were a person, it’d be at the legal drinking
    age (here in Australia). And it has a lot to celebrate, it’s come
    a long way in that time. What started as scribblings on a
    blackboard in a meeting of seventeen programmers has since grown
    to take the business world by storm. Some would even say it’s
    grown out of control <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M">(some of the
    original authors, no less)</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this post, I want to rediscover the essence of agility by
    looking at an example of an industry that exhibits the principles
    outlined in the original manifesto, despite not even being aware
    of it. This essentially means that they have independently
    discovered the ideas of agile development, but because they
    missed the surrounding hype, they’ve managed to avoid a lot of
    the unnecessary baggage that tends to follow “Agile” in practice.
    My goal is to make people refocus on what is really important and
    valuable about agile software development, and see past the noise
    that has built up around it.

    I continued building tiny, incomplete games with Game Maker for a
    couple of years, never really making anything substantial but
    still learning a lot. And while I was enjoying the act of making
    games, and I certainly enjoyed playing games, I didn’t really
    enjoy playing my games. Partly because they weren’t very good,
    but also because I knew how they worked, how to beat them, and I
    didn’t get the same feeling of discovery that I got playing other
    games. And as the enjoyment of playing the games diminished, so
    too did the enjoyment of making them. I wasn’t sure whether I
    should be programming for the sake of programming, or programming
    for the outcome.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, I was spending a great deal of time playing an
    online game, which will remain nameless. The client for playing
    this game had an IRC chat window below the main game window,
    which I would use to chat with my friends while playing. One of
    my friends was also a programmer, and he knew how to make IRC
    bots. If I recall correctly, his bot simply helped administer the
    channel—it would grant certain users permissions when they
    joined, kick people out when they broke the rules, it could even
    run a little trivia game. It didn’t do anything terribly
    exciting, but I could see the potential.

    My first exposure to programming was some time around the turn of
    the century with a program called Game Maker, which as the name
    suggests, was built for making games. Game Maker actually
    supported a decent amount of graphical programming by
    dragging-and-dropping icons around the screen to describe the
    behaviour of different objects in the game, but as soon as I
    learnt that there was another way to do it that had more
    features, I wanted to learn that.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tutorial for the scripting language in Game Maker at the time
    walked you through programming a little game similar to Space
    Invaders, where you controlled a space ship at the bottom of the
    screen and the goal was to shoot the enemy ships approaching from
    the top of the screen. I followed the instructions closely,
    typing in all the code it supplied to define the behaviour for
    moving and shooting, including a cooldown for the gun so that you
    wouldn’t just fire off a shot every game tick. And then they gave
    you an exercise, to add a second weapon to the ship that was
    triggered from a separate key and that had its own cooldown. And
    I was stumped.

    If like me, you need to make Git commits from multiple email
    addresses on the same machine (say, from your personal and your
    work address), here’s a handy trick that will help make sure you
    make every commit with the right address.
  </p>
  <p>
    Start by creating a directory for each profile, named after the
    profile. In my case, I have <code>D:/git/home</code> and
    <code>D:/git/work</code>. Move all your Git repositories into
    the directory corresponding to the profile that you want to use
    when making commits to that repository. At the root of your
    profile directories, create a <code>.gitconfig</code> file with
    the following content.

    When working with large systems, especially with software,
    inevitably something will go wrong and you’ll be stuck trying to
    diagnose it. My years of developing software have given me a lot
    of practice diagnosing errors or unintended behaviour in software
    systems (usually in my own code), and over time I’ve built up a
    systematic process that I run through to speed up the process. In
    writing this post, I came to realise that my process actually has
    quite a lot in common with 12-step programs, so I’ve tweaked the
    format a little to make the content a little more interesting.

    One of my great joys when designing things is when I discover
    that I can lift a restriction and make something both simpler and
    more powerful at the same time. This can happen at all levels,
    from something like changing a function signature to make it more
    generic, right up to unifying high level system components. The
    more generic something is, the more situations you can use it in,
    and the more value it can provide.

  <h2>What’s the purpose of a programming language?</h2>
  <p>
    A programming language is an interface between humans and
    computers, that allows us to program computers to perform some
    task. The purpose of the task is usually to solve some particular
    problem that the human has. Most languages are <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing
    complete</a>, which essentially means that they are mostly all
    equivalent. So what’s the point of creating a new programming
    language if it’s equivalent to ones that already exist? Turing
    completeness means that languages are equivalent in terms of the
    programs they are able to express, but it says nothing about the
    journey of getting to the finished program.

    May 20, 2016. My Git streak comes to an abrupt end on 199 days.
    Today, GitHub disabled the commit streak feature and left me
    stranded one day short of a milestone. It feels a little
    frustrating to get so close and then have it taken away, but in
    the end the overwhelming feeling is actually one of relief.
  </p>

    I’m a chronic procrastinator and a prolific sidetracker—I’ve
    always had trouble following through on things after the initial
    whirl of enthusiastic development dies down. More often than not,
    it’s not so much that I get bored of the project I’m working,
    it’s that I get distracted by something else more exciting. I’ve
    tried lots of different approaches to improve this, but haven’t
    had much success.

    This phrase is part of the C philosophy, and has influenced the
    design of many programming languages. In general C usage, this is
    best observed by the use of pointer casts—a mechanism by which
    the programmer can bypass the type system, trading compile-time
    type safety for flexibility and potentially incurring fatal
    crashes at run-time. The phrase needs little explanation—the
    programmer knows what they’re doing, don’t get in their way.

    The static keyword has origins as far back as C, and has carried
    across to C++, Java and C#, among others—although its meaning has
    changed a bit along the way. In C# and Java, one of the common
    uses is for class-level sharing of members. Static members don’t
    belong to any instance, and can only be accessed directly from
    the class or from another definition in the same class.
  </p>
  <p>
    And this is all well and good for sharing within a class, but the
    problem is that it doesn’t play well with inheritance, because
    static members cannot be overridden. And inheritance is another
    common method of achieving code sharing. Consider the following
    snippet, which shows how one might hope to override static
    members in C#.

    After first being introduced to the concept of Church numerals in

    about them and the more general topic,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church
    encoding</a>. For those who don’t know, Church encoding defines a
    way to represent common data types and structures in the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda
    calculus</a> using only functions, since functions are the only
    terms available.
  </p>
  <p>
    I eventually stumbled upon a pretty neat intuition for how Church
    encodings work, which enables you to create encodings for
    arbitrary data types very easily. But first, a little on how I
    got there…
