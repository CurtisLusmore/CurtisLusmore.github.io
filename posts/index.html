              Whenever I interview for a job at a company, there‚Äôs one question
              that I make sure to ask every single person I can.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                What‚Äôs the one thing you would miss the most if you left
                $COMPANY_NAME?
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              When I interviewed at <a href="https://readify.net">Readify</a>,
              everybody said it was the people. Not in the ‚Äúthese people are my
              best friends‚Äù sense, although that may very well be the case, but
              more importantly in the ‚Äúthis is the smartest, most passionate,
              most supportive, most inspiring bunch of people I‚Äôve ever worked
              with‚Äù sense. Seeing a handful of Readifarians present at
              <a href="https://www.dddbrisbane.com/">DDD Brisbane</a> in 2017
              is what attracted me to Readify in the first place, so I had a
              strong feeling this was going to be a common answer when I was
              asking the question.

              In my time so far working in software development, as a developer
              and as a product manager, I‚Äôve made and seen a lot of mistakes. I
              spent some time recently reflecting on some of the biggest
              mistakes, the ones that ultimately cost the most time or money,
              that caused the most frustration and heartache, and tried to
              devise some lessons learnt. In the end I realised that the vast
              majority of mistakes were actually variants of the same core
              mistake, and that one main lesson applied to all of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this post I will discuss this mistake, some examples of where
              it comes up in software development, some thoughts on why it
              keeps happening, and some tips on how to avoid it.

              What do a junior and a senior developer have in common? They both
              constantly feel like they have absolutely no idea what they‚Äôre
              doing. What‚Äôs the difference between a junior and a senior
              developer? The senior developer knows that this is completely
              normal. One of the things about programming is that if you‚Äôre
              doing something you‚Äôve done before, you‚Äôre usually doing it
              wrong. And by this I mean that if you‚Äôre trying to solve a
              problem you‚Äôve solved before, you should just reuse the solution
              from last time.
            </p>
            <p>
              We‚Äôre lucky in the world of software that we can do this, but one
              of the consequences of this is that most software development is
              almost by definition something that has never been done before,
              at least by you. If you work in software, you‚Äôd better get used
              to this feeling. It‚Äôs easy to look at all the people around you
              at work or in the community and the great work that they do and
              think they must know what they‚Äôre doing. ‚ÄúThese people are real
              developers, I‚Äôm just an impostor. One day they‚Äôll all realise I
              am completely out of my depth and I‚Äôll be fired.‚Äù This feeling is

              What is computer science really about? In the present day,
              despite being such a relatively young and immature field,
              computer science employs millions of people all over the world,
              it produces the technologies that run our lives, and it is
              responsible for countless billions or trillions of dollars of
              value. Even going into the near-term future, the software that
              has been built over the last few decades will continue to affect
              the daily lives of people for generations to come.
            </p>
            <p>
              But to me, that‚Äôs just commercial success. At the end of the day,
              or perhaps better to say at the end of the millenium, will
              anybody really care? If we made contact with an alien race, would
              we brag about our ability to share cat photos with millions of
              strangers, or even our ability to build billion dollar companies?
              There must be some deeper meaning to this all. I can feel it.
              When I‚Äôm programming or problem solving, I feel like I‚Äôm
              exploring. But what am I exploring?

              Today marks the 18th anniversary of the final day of the meeting
              at Snowbird which ultimately lead to the creation of the
              <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile software development
              manifesto</a>. If it were a person, it‚Äôd be at the legal drinking
              age (here in Australia). And it has a lot to celebrate, it‚Äôs come
              a long way in that time. What started as scribblings on a
              blackboard in a meeting of seventeen programmers has since grown
              to take the business world by storm. Some would even say it‚Äôs
              grown out of control <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M">(some of the
              original authors, no less)</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this post, I want to rediscover the essence of agility by
              looking at an example of an industry that exhibits the principles
              outlined in the original manifesto, despite not even being aware
              of it. This essentially means that they have independently
              discovered the ideas of agile development, but because they
              missed the surrounding hype, they‚Äôve managed to avoid a lot of
              the unnecessary baggage that tends to follow ‚ÄúAgile‚Äù in practice.
              My goal is to make people refocus on what is really important and
              valuable about agile software development, and see past the noise
              that has built up around it.

              I continued building tiny, incomplete games with Game Maker for a
              couple of years, never really making anything substantial but
              still learning a lot. And while I was enjoying the act of making
              games, and I certainly enjoyed playing games, I didn‚Äôt really
              enjoy playing my games. Partly because they weren‚Äôt very good,
              but also because I knew how they worked, how to beat them, and I
              didn‚Äôt get the same feeling of discovery that I got playing other
              games. And as the enjoyment of playing the games diminished, so
              too did the enjoyment of making them. I wasn‚Äôt sure whether I
              should be programming for the sake of programming, or programming
              for the outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the same time, I was spending a great deal of time playing an
              online game, which will remain nameless. The client for playing
              this game had an IRC chat window below the main game window,
              which I would use to chat with my friends while playing. One of
              my friends was also a programmer, and he knew how to make IRC
              bots. If I recall correctly, his bot simply helped administer the
              channel‚Äîit would grant certain users permissions when they
              joined, kick people out when they broke the rules, it could even
              run a little trivia game. It didn‚Äôt do anything terribly
              exciting, but I could see the potential.

              My first exposure to programming was some time around the turn of
              the century with a program called Game Maker, which as the name
              suggests, was built for making games. Game Maker actually
              supported a decent amount of graphical programming by
              dragging-and-dropping icons around the screen to describe the
              behaviour of different objects in the game, but as soon as I
              learnt that there was another way to do it that had more
              features, I wanted to learn that.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tutorial for the scripting language in Game Maker at the time
              walked you through programming a little game similar to Space
              Invaders, where you controlled a space ship at the bottom of the
              screen and the goal was to shoot the enemy ships approaching from
              the top of the screen. I followed the instructions closely,
              typing in all the code it supplied to define the behaviour for
              moving and shooting, including a cooldown for the gun so that you
              wouldn‚Äôt just fire off a shot every game tick. And then they gave
              you an exercise, to add a second weapon to the ship that was
              triggered from a separate key and that had its own cooldown. And
              I was stumped.

              If like me, you need to make Git commits from multiple email
              addresses on the same machine (say, from your personal and your
              work address), here‚Äôs a handy trick that will help make sure you
              make every commit with the right address.
            </p>
            <p>
              Start by creating a directory for each profile, named after the
              profile. In my case, I have <code>D:/git/home</code> and
              <code>D:/git/work</code>. Move all your Git repositories into
              the directory corresponding to the profile that you want to use
              when making commits to that repository. At the root of your
              profile directories, create a <code>.gitconfig</code> file with
              the following content.

              This is a technique that I discovered several years ago while
              teaching an introductory programming course, and I was extremely
              pleased to find out that although it had already been discovered,
              I had given it the same name. <a

              >Programming by wishful thinking</a> is a style of top-down
              program design that helps you improve the structure of your code,
              isolate the hairy parts from the simple parts, think more clearly
              about data flow, and work faster. I find it particularly helpful
              for novice programmers who feel intimidated when starting a new
              project and aren‚Äôt sure how to get started, but I still practise
              it regularly as well.

              When working with large systems, especially with software,
              inevitably something will go wrong and you‚Äôll be stuck trying to
              diagnose it. My years of developing software have given me a lot
              of practice diagnosing errors or unintended behaviour in software
              systems (usually in my own code), and over time I‚Äôve built up a
              systematic process that I run through to speed up the process. In
              writing this post, I came to realise that my process actually has
              quite a lot in common with 12-step programs, so I‚Äôve tweaked the
              format a little to make the content a little more interesting.

              One of my great joys when designing things is when I discover
              that I can lift a restriction and make something both simpler and
              more powerful at the same time. This can happen at all levels,
              from something like changing a function signature to make it more
              generic, right up to unifying high level system components. The
              more generic something is, the more situations you can use it in,
              and the more value it can provide.

            <h2>What‚Äôs the purpose of a programming language?</h2>
            <p>
              A programming language is an interface between humans and
              computers, that allows us to program computers to perform some
              task. The purpose of the task is usually to solve some particular
              problem that the human has. Most languages are <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing
              complete</a>, which essentially means that they are mostly all
              equivalent. So what‚Äôs the point of creating a new programming
              language if it‚Äôs equivalent to ones that already exist? Turing
              completeness means that languages are equivalent in terms of the
              programs they are able to express, but it says nothing about the
              journey of getting to the finished program.

              May 20, 2016. My Git streak comes to an abrupt end on 199 days.
              Today, GitHub disabled the commit streak feature and left me
              stranded one day short of a milestone. It feels a little
              frustrating to get so close and then have it taken away, but in
              the end the overwhelming feeling is actually one of relief.

              This phrase is part of the C philosophy, and has influenced the
              design of many programming languages. In general C usage, this is
              best observed by the use of pointer casts‚Äîa mechanism by which
              the programmer can bypass the type system, trading compile-time
              type safety for flexibility and potentially incurring fatal
              crashes at run-time. The phrase needs little explanation‚Äîthe
              programmer knows what they‚Äôre doing, don‚Äôt get in their way.

              The static keyword has origins as far back as C, and has carried
              across to C++, Java and C#, among others‚Äîalthough its meaning has
              changed a bit along the way. In C# and Java, one of the common
              uses is for class-level sharing of members. Static members don‚Äôt
              belong to any instance, and can only be accessed directly from
              the class or from another definition in the same class.
            </p>
            <p>
              And this is all well and good for sharing within a class, but the
              problem is that it doesn‚Äôt play well with inheritance, because
              static members cannot be overridden. And inheritance is another
              common method of achieving code sharing. Consider the following
              snippet, which shows how one might hope to override static
              members in C#.

              After first being introduced to the concept of Church numerals in
              <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure and
              Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, I decided to learn more
              about them and the more general topic,
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church
              encoding</a>. For those who don‚Äôt know, Church encoding defines a
              way to represent common data types and structures in the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda

            <p>
              I eventually stumbled upon a pretty neat intuition for how Church
              encodings work, which enables you to create encodings for
              arbitrary data types very easily. But first, a little on how I

              by people who want to get into programming, or maybe they‚Äôve just

              thinking about where to go next. It‚Äôs an innocent enough question
