          Whenever I interview for a job at a company, there’s one question
          that I make sure to ask every single person I can.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            What’s the one thing you would miss the most if you left
            $COMPANY_NAME?
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          When I interviewed at <a href="https://readify.net">Readify</a>,
          everybody said it was the people. Not in the “these people are my
          best friends” sense, although that may very well be the case, but
          more importantly in the “this is the smartest, most passionate, most
          supportive, most inspiring bunch of people I’ve ever worked with”
          sense. Seeing a handful of Readifarians present at <a
          href="https://www.dddbrisbane.com/">DDD Brisbane</a> in 2017 is what
          attracted me to Readify in the first place, so I had a strong feeling
          this was going to be a common answer when I was asking the question.
        </p>
        <p>
          I applied for a job here soon after, and although I was unsuccessful
          at first, when my wife and I decided to move down to Melbourne and I
          started looking for opportunities again Readify was the first company
          that came to mind. This time I was lucky enough to get an offer, and
          I’ve been working here now for just over eight months. And now that
          I’m on the inside, I couldn’t possibly agree more with their answers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last month was <a href="https://www.dddmelbourne.com/">DDD
          Melbourne</a>, and this time I was part of the <a
          href="https://twitter.com/meliss_houghton/status/1161051438480388096"
          >crew</a> alongside a dozen or so other Readifarians. Throughout the
          day when I mentioned to people I’d meet that I work at Readify, I
          got universally positive responses. “It must be amazing working with
          so many great people.”
        </p>
        <p>
          People are really important to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my previous post <a href="/posts/take-a-step-back">Take a Step
          Back</a>, I talked about how at the top layer of software development
          is the vision and focus of your business, how all of the layers below
          need to align to this, and how badly things can go wrong when they
          don’t. Everything in that post still sits inside the context of
          solving a genuine human problem. If what you’re building doesn’t
          matter to somebody, why are you building it?
        </p>
        <p>
          The other main reason I decided to come work at Readify is because as
          a consultant, I have a constant stream of opportunities to help
          different companies solve their challenges and seize their
          opportunities. To help them improve their software development
          processes and culture, so that they can focus more on delivering
          better outcomes to their customers. To help them be more purposeful
          in what they do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Purpose is really important to me too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today we announced that Readify and several other Telstra
          acquisitions will be joining forces to form <a
          href="https://exchange.telstra.com.au/meet-the-new-enterprise-better-together-with-telstra-purple/"
          >Telstra Purple</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Change can be scary—especially changes to your identity. Rightly so,
          people get very attached to and emotionally invested in their
          identity. When we were first told that our identity—the Readify brand
          which means so much to us—would be put aside, it was scary.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the fear very quickly went away for me when we all started
          talking, as a group, about who we are, what we care about, what we
          stand for. When I realised that we have a group of fifteen-hundred
          plus people who all care deeply about people and purpose.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            We believe it’s people who give purpose to our technology, and it’s
            the power of purposeful technology that inspires people. Putting
            purpose and people at the core of everything we do brings a
            brilliantly connected future closer to your reach.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I love working for a company that cares about the same things as me.
          To care about them so strongly that we literally smash them together
          to make our name. People and purpose, purpose and people. Purple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Readify has always cared about purpose and people. They’re embedded
          in many of our <a href="https://readify.net/about">six beliefs</a>.
          We trust and empower our people. We embrace diversity. We love
          learning. We live for our community. We apply an agile mindset to
          everything. We are invested in our customer’s success.
        </p>
        <p>
          These beliefs will always be with us, with or without the Readify
          name. I’m really excited to be able to share these beliefs with so
          many more people in Telstra Purple, and to share in their beliefs as
          well. To work with an even bigger bunch of smart, passionate,
          supportive and inspiring people. And with access to such a broad
          range of capabilities, I really think we will be able to deliver on
          much more meaningful purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          To those who know and love Readify: don’t be afraid of this change,
          we’re only going to get better! My goal for next year’s DDD Melbourne
          is to be able to introduce myself as working at Telstra Purple and
          get an even stronger universally positive response.
