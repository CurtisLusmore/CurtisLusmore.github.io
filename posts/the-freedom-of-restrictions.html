          One of my great joys when designing things is when I discover that I
          can lift a restriction and make something both simpler and more
          powerful at the same time. This can happen at all levels, from
          something like changing a function signature to make it more generic,
          right up to unifying high level system components. The more generic
          something is, the more situations you can use it in, and the more
          value it can provide.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there comes a point where something can be too general—where it
          permits far too wide a range of uses, and it starts to cause more
          problems than it solves. One famous example of this is the
          <code>goto</code> statement. Edsger Dijkstra wrote about its dangers
          in 1968 in his letter <a target="_blank"
          href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rubinson/copyright_violations/Go_To_Considered_Harmful.html">
          The Go To Statement Considered Harmful</a>, and Donald Knuth wrote in
          his 1974 paper <a target="_blank"
          href="https://www.cs.sjsu.edu/%7Emak/CS185C/KnuthStructuredProgrammingGoTo.pdf">
          Structured Programming with Go To Statements</a> about how the
          majority of the dangers can be avoided by adding some restrictions to
          its usage.
        </p>

          As we now all know, there are a handful of control structures that
          the <code>goto</code> statement was used to simulate which are
          perfectly safe and well understood—<code>if</code>,
          <code>switch</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>,
          <code>break</code>, <code>return</code>, function calls, etc.
          Anything else was usually too complicated and error prone. The
          problem with using raw <code>goto</code> statements was that it
          wasn’t always clear which of the good structures the author was
          intending to use, and it was easy to make subtle mistakes that went
          unnoticed and caused huge problems. And so we all agreed that despite
          the fact that a single statement is more general and can do all the
          work of the other handful of control structures and more, we’d be
          better off without it.
        </p>
        <p>
          By restricting ourselves to using only well understood control
          structures, we free ourselves from the possibility of writing
          error-prone, incomprehensible spaghetti.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s worth thinking about whether adding restrictions to other tools
          and techniques we use could actually make our lives easier. I think
          we are starting to see that even the <code>for</code> loop is more
          trouble than its worth, as more and more languages embrace higher
          level, more expressive forms like <code>map</code>,
          <code>filter</code> and <code>reduce</code>. Much of the benefit of
          functional programming comes from restricting use of the assignment
          operator. Concurrency is another area that I think would benefit from
          some restrictions. Programming directly with threads and locks is
          incredibly flexible, but it’s also fraught with potential race
          conditions, deadlocks and data integrity issues. Restricting
          ourselves to well understood abstractions like the actor model
          would free us from the hassle of dealing with these problems.
