    In the tech world, the common wisdom is that when things go wrong we have
    blameless post-mortems. The idea here is that preventing the triggering
    event from occurring is only part of the solution. The other part, often
    the bigger part, is mitigating other factors which cause the event to have
    such a large impact. Sometimes it’s not possible to prevent all triggering
    events, and we can improve our resilience and reliability more effectively
    by mitigating common contributing factors to outages.
  </p>
  <p>
    We ask questions like, “Can we detect the triggering event sooner?” “Can we
    speed up our response process?”  “Can we limit the number of people
    impacted, or the degree to which they are impacted?” “Can we automate an
    error-prone manual process?” “Can we allow a system to self-correct?”
  </p>
  <p>
    If a human accidentally runs a destructive query against your production
    database, the question isn’t, “Why did they do that?” It’s, “Why were they
    able to do that?” “Why did they need to do that?” “Are we missing tools
    that could do this safer?” “Can we recover from this faster?” Mistakes are
    inevitable. What matters more than trying to prevent all mistakes from
    happening, is improving our processes to mitigate the impact and recover
    faster.

    This Numberphile video, <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku8BOBwD4hc">Stable Rollers</a>, is a
    really simple analogy that shows the difference between recovering well and
    recovering poorly from errors, and how this is far more important to
    resilience than eliminating initial errors.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think we do this pretty well in the tech world, but this certainly isn’t
    universal across all fields. The politics of the last year or so have shown
    us that it’s easy to get sucked into focusing on the triggers rather than
    all of the causes.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the bushfires last summer, parts of the media seemed to be more
    interested in what triggered the fires, lightning strikes or arsonists,
    rather than what caused them to be so bad, climate change.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the pandemic, as Victoria entered its second lockdown, the media
    were more interested in what triggered the second wave than they were in
    whether the government’s plan would help us recover from it. Don’t get me
    wrong, the second wave was tough and a lot of people suffered or died from
    it. But the cause of that suffering, here and to a far greater extent
    internationally, isn’t the initial triggering outbreak. It’s the response,
    or lack thereof, which allows the virus to spread so rapidly. The countries
    that have done best owe more to their response to domestic spread than to
    their ability to prevent imported cases.
  </p>
  <p>
    This extends to the blame game surrounding the origins of the virus itself.
    For a country to blame all of the suffering they’ve experienced on China is
    to consider themselves powerless to mitigate the causes of spread
    domestically, and to admit that they would also be powerless to stop an
    actual biological weapon were one ever to be used.
  </p>
  <p>
    We should stop focusing so much on the triggering events and start focusing
    more on what causes the event to spiral out of control. Mistakes are
    inevitable and you can't eliminate all triggers, but you can improve your
    processes for responding and mitigating causes. As I said, I think in tech
    we do this better than most other industries, but it will probably take
    sustained, deliberate effort by all of us to keep it that way.
