    One of the things that you do when you become a parent for the first time
    is you imagine what your child’s first word will be. I remember thinking
    that the most likely words would be mama or dada, but with so many words
    to choose from, the likelihood would be that it would be some other random
    word like book, shoe or head.
  </p>
  <p>
    What I never imagined was how hard it would be to define "first" or "word".
  </p>
  <p>
    To adults, words seem to be a fairly concrete concept. A simple and
    hopefully uncontroversial definition of "word" might be "a sound uttered
    intentionally with a specific meaning understood by both speaker and
    listener". I’m not sure if I ever thought it through this thoroughly, but I
    think I always imagined that the thing I considered to be my child’s first
    word would be reasonably fully-formed, I would be reasonably sure it was
    intentional, and reasonably sure that they were trying to convey meaning.
  </p>
  <p>
    But those are the three key points that I’ll keep coming back to--a sound,
    intention, and meaning.
  </p>
  <p>
    Babies start babbling quite early on and will try to mimic various aspects
    of what you say to them, like sound and rhythm. At this early stage, they
    aren’t able to reliably reproduce the same sound, they are merely
    responding to what they hear so they are not intentional about what sounds
    they make, and certainly no meaning is conveyed. Their ability to make
    sounds, form intentions, and understand meaning each develop as they grow.
  </p>
  <p>
    The range of sounds they can make grows at a fairly steady pace with
    practice as they continue to repeat what they hear.
