    My first exposure to programming was some time around the turn of the
    century with a program called Game Maker, which as the name suggests,
    was built for making games. Game Maker actually supported a decent
    amount of graphical programming by dragging-and-dropping icons around
    the screen to describe the behaviour of different objects in the
    game, but as soon as I learnt that there was another way to do it
    that had more features, I wanted to learn that.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tutorial for the scripting language in Game Maker at the time
    walked you through programming a little game similar to Space
    Invaders, where you controlled a space ship at the bottom of the
    screen and the goal was to shoot the enemy ships approaching from the
    top of the screen. I followed the instructions closely, typing in all
    the code it supplied to define the behaviour for moving and shooting,
    including a cooldown for the gun so that you wouldn’t just fire off
    a shot every game tick. And then they gave you an exercise, to add a
    second weapon to the ship that was triggered from a separate key and
    that had its own cooldown. And I was stumped.
  </p>
  <p>
    I looked back over all the code they had supplied to me so far. When
    you press the Space key, it first checks the value of
    <code>can_shoot</code>. If it’s <code>true</code>, create a
    bullet, set <code>can_shoot</code> to <code>false</code>, then start
    a timer for half a second. When the timer goes off, set
    <code>can_shoot</code> back to <code>true</code> again. Well that all
    makes sense and it’s great for the first gun, but what’s the
    equivalent of <code>can_shoot</code> for the second gun? They didn’t
    tell me the name of the second cooldown. I tried searching through
    the documentation for the name of the second cooldown, but couldn’t
    find it anywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    This really frustrated me, because I was having so much fun up until
    this point watching a game come to life on the screen in front of me
    based on what I was typing with my fingers. And now I was stuck
    beacuse the tutorial missed such an important detail! I kept staring
    at what my screen, hoping for a clue.
  </p>
  <p>
    And then I had my first great epiphany of programming. I
    <em>made</em> <code>can_shoot</code>. It’s not special. It’s not some
    magical thing built into the language that already knows how to
    handle the cooldown for a gun. I <em>made</em> it understand how to
    handle the cooldown for a gun. I explicitly wrote out every single
    detail of its behaviour. Its starting value, how its value affects
    the behaviour of the game, how its value changes based on the actions
    that occur in the game, how the timer resets it. I made it do what it
    does, and if I wanted to I could make it do something else. And that
    was it, I was hooked.
  </p>
  <p>
    Years later, when I taught intro to programming to first-year
    university students, I would have the privilege of seeing this same
    epiphany occur in the minds of hundreds of budding programmers. But
    we’ll get to that part of my journey later.
