          My first exposure to programming was some time around the turn of the
          century with a program called Game Maker, which as the name suggests,
          was built for making games. Game Maker actually supported a decent
          amount of graphical programming by dragging-and-dropping icons around
          the screen to describe the behaviour of different objects in the
          game, but as soon as I learnt that there was another way to do it
          that had more features, I wanted to learn that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tutorial for the scripting language in Game Maker at the time
          walked you through programming a little game similar to Space
          Invaders, where you controlled a space ship at the bottom of the
          screen and the goal was to shoot the enemy ships approaching from the
          top of the screen. I followed the instructions closely, typing in all
          the code it supplied to define the behaviour for moving and shooting,
          including a cooldown for the gun so that you wouldn’t just fire off
          a shot every game tick. And then they gave you an exercise, to add a
          second weapon to the ship that was triggered from a separate key and
          that had its own cooldown. And I was stumped.
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked back over all the code they had supplied to me so far. When
          you press the Space key, it first checks the value of
          <code>can_shoot</code>. If it’s <code>true</code>, create a
          bullet, set <code>can_shoot</code> to <code>false</code>, then start
          a timer for half a second. When the timer goes off, set
          <code>can_shoot</code> back to <code>true</code> again. Well that all
          makes sense and it’s great for the first gun, but what’s the
          equivalent of <code>can_shoot</code> for the second gun? They didn’t
          tell me the name of the second cooldown. I tried searching through
          the documentation for the name of the second cooldown, but couldn’t
          find it anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          This really frustrated me, because I was having so much fun up until
          this point watching a game come to life on the screen in front of me
          based on what I was typing with my fingers. And now I was stuck
          beacuse the tutorial missed such an important detail! I kept staring
          at what my screen, hoping for a clue.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then I had my first great epiphany of programming. I
          <em>made</em> <code>can_shoot</code>. It’s not special. It’s not some
          magical thing built into the language that already knows how to
          handle the cooldown for a gun. I <em>made</em> it understand how to
          handle the cooldown for a gun. I explicitly wrote out every single
          detail of its behaviour. Its starting value, how its value affects
          the behaviour of the game, how its value changes based on the actions
          that occur in the game, how the timer resets it. I made it do what it
          does, and if I wanted to I could make it do something else. And that
          was it, I was hooked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Years later, when I taught intro to programming to first-year
          university students, I would have the privilege of seeing this same
          epiphany occur in the minds of hundreds of budding programmers. But
          we’ll get to that part of my journey later.
