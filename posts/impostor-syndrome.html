    What do a junior and a senior developer have in common? They both
    constantly feel like they have absolutely no idea what they’re doing.
    What’s the difference between a junior and a senior developer? The
    senior developer knows that this is completely normal. One of the
    things about programming is that if you’re doing something you’ve
    done before, you’re usually doing it wrong. And by this I mean that
    if you’re trying to solve a problem you’ve solved before, you should
    just reuse the solution from last time.

    We’re lucky in the world of software that we can do this, but one of
    the consequences of this is that most software development is almost
    by definition something that has never been done before, at least by
    you. If you work in software, you’d better get used to this feeling.
    It’s easy to look at all the people around you at work or in the
    community and the great work that they do and think they must know
    what they’re doing. “These people are real developers, I’m just an
    impostor. One day they’ll all realise I am completely out of my depth
    and I’ll be fired.” This feeling is so common that it has a
    name—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome"
    >impostor syndrome</a>.

    So is software development really just a case of the blind leading
    the blind? Well, of course as you use particular tools and
    technologies you get better at them, and when you have the chance to
    mentor less experienced developers, you can actually teach them some
    things. And this has the unfortunate effect of reinforcing the
    feeling of impostor syndrome for them. But generally these skills
    aren’t especially valuable—anybody can pick them up pretty quickly
    and they don’t represent any natural progression. But there’s another
    skill that developers tend to pick up the more experience they get,
    which I think is one of the key differences between a junior and a
    senior developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The act of software development is a bit like navigating through a
    maze. No matter how many mazes you’ve solved before, when you’re
    solving a maze for the first time you literally don’t know where
    you’re going. Regardless of your skill or experience level, you will
    feel like you don’t know where you’re going. This is just the reality
    of life as a maze solver, or a software developer. With experience
    you start to develop some techniques for solving mazes more
    efficiently. You develop tricks which work in some cases, like
    working backwards from the finish. You learn how to sense when you’re
    about to hit a dead-end, or when you’re going in circles, and you’re
    able to backtrack and find a new path more quickly. You develop an
    intuition for when something feels harder than it should, which
    suggests to you there’s probably a better path.
  </p>
  <p>
    But at the end of the day, you still spend a great deal of your time
    bumbling around. If you’re a developer who feels out of your depth,
    I’m here to tell you I’m right there with you, just trying to stay
    barely one step ahead so my cover isn’t blown.
