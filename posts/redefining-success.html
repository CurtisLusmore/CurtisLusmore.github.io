    There’s an expression in tech that I think is often misunderstood and then
    used to justify bad behaviour—“fail fast, fail early”. The idea behind it
    is that if an idea is going to fail, it’s better if it fails early, before
    you reach the point of the sunk-cost fallacy.
  </p>
  <p>
    This sounds sensible, and encourages people to <a
    href="/posts/minimum-viewable-program">build a Pilot rather than a Season
    1</a>, which I think is generally a good thing. But I have two major
    concerns with this expression.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        It tricks people into thinking that if we want to fail quickly, then we
        need to finish quickly. “Let’s just try this real quick and see if it
        works”. This shrinks all deadlines and can lead to rushed, low-quality
        work even in the “success” case.
      </li>
      <li>
        It normalises failure, which isn’t actually the goal. The goal is rapid
        validated learning. Failure can lead to validated learning, but not all
        failures are created equally.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    I propose instead that we redefine what success and failure mean when doing
    experimental development work. When we set out to prove or disprove a given
    hypothesis, success is getting an outcome, no matter which way it falls. We
    only fail if we are unable to determine the result.
  </p>
  <p>
    If I’m trying to test a new feature, I can spike a simple version and show
    it to a small subset of customers. If they like it, I can say I succeeded
    in showing that customers like the feature. If they don’t, I can say I
    succeeded in showing that they don’t.
  </p>
  <p>
    If I start building the feature but abandon it after months of delays, I’ve
    done neither. Even if I build and ship the feature but never measure the
    reaction to it, I’ve done neither. I’ve failed to prove or disprove whether
    customers like the feature. Maybe I’ve proven whether or not I can build
    the feature, but honestly this is rarely the biggest concern in software
    development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Framing success this way helps to address my two concerns with “fail fast,
    fail early”.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Success doesn’t necessarily mean “we successfully built and shipped
        production-grade software”, it can just mean “we successfully
        proved/<wbr>disproved demand for a feature”. It’s okay if the deadline
        for this is short, we can invest time in productionising once we prove
        demand.
      </li>
      <li>
        We aren’t normalising failure, failure isn’t really a good thing.
        Disproving a hypothesis is good. We knew something was a risk or
        assumption and we made a deliberate plan to validate it quickly or
        cheaply. We didn’t just take a wild stab at something and hope for the
        best.
      </li>
    </ol>
