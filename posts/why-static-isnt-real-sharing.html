        <p>
          The static keyword has origins as far back as C, and has carried
          across to C++, Java and C#, among others—although its meaning has
          changed a bit along the way. In C# and Java, one of the common uses
          is for class-level sharing of members. Static members don’t belong to
          any instance, and can only be accessed directly from the class or
          from another definition in the same class.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is all well and good for sharing within a class, but the
          problem is that it doesn’t play well with inheritance, because static
          members cannot be overridden. And inheritance is another common
          method of achieving code sharing. Consider the following snippet,
          which shows how one might hope to override static members in C#.
        </p>
        <pre>
public class Base
{
    public static virtual string Value => "Base";
    public static virtual void Display() =>
        Console.WriteLine(Value);
}

public class Sub1 : Base
{
    public static override string Value => "Sub1";
}

public class Sub2 : Base
{
    public static override void Display() =>
        Console.WriteLine($">>> {Value}");
}

new Sub1().Display(); // Sub1

new Sub2().Display(); // >>> Base
</pre>
          <p>
            We would like to be able to override one or both of the
            <code>Value</code> and <code>Display</code> members, but
            unfortunately this won’t compile because static members can’t be
            virtual. Python, on the other hand, got this exactly right—thanks
            to the <code>classmethod</code> decorator.
          </p>
          <pre>
class Base:
    value = 'base'
    @classmethod
    def display(cls):
        print(cls.vlaue)

class Sub1(Base):
    value = 'Sub1'

class Sub2(Base):
    @classmethod
    def display(cls):
        print('>>>', cls.value)

Sub1().display() # Sub1

Sub2().display() # >>> Base
          </pre>
          <p>
            So how come Python can do this but C# can’t? Notice that we used
            the <code>classmethod</code> decorator, not the
            <code>staticmethod</code> decorator. The <code>classmethod</code>
            decorator benefits from the fact that it is passed a reference to
            the class, whereas in the case of the staticmethod decorator you
            need to hard-code it into source. This distinction really
            highlights the real meaning of the word static—the static of static
            analysis, static type checking, static libraries, and static memory
            allocation. Static as in not dynamic, known before run-time, often
            at compile-time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason why static members can’t be overridden is because doing
            so requires knowing at run-time which override to use, which goes
            against the definition of the word static. Even in a language like
            Python without compilation, the concept of static still exists and
            still has the same restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            So if we want to get truly shareable members, both horizontally
            across members of a class and vertically across a type hierarchy,
            we are going to need another solution.
