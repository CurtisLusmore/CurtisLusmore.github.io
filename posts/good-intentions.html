    We make a lot of decisions in software development. Compared to other
    fields of engineering, the process of building software relative to
    designing it is very rapid, shrinking the time between decisions and
    also typically shrinking the time spent on decisions. Modern agile
    software development methodology only exacerbates this problem. “Move
    fast and break things”.
  </p>
  <p>
    On top of this, software systems will often stay under active
    development for decades, growing to be unfathomably large and
    complex. In complex systems decisions in one area often have
    implications in other seemingly unrelated areas, making us hesitant
    to make quick decisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a consultant I bounce in and out of different organisations every
    few months, meaning I’m constantly onboarding and offboarding. In
    between onboarding and offboarding, my job is often to help make a
    bunch of decisions. Each time I onboard I have to quickly understand
    existing decisions so that my work aligns to them, and as I offboard
    I have to make sure any decisions I made are understood by the rest
    of the team. Having clearly defined intentions behind decisions is
    critical for this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good intentions not only help understand why decisions were made,
    they help you remember and work with the decision itself. As an
    example, I fairly recently moved to Melbourne—a city notorious for
    its confusing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_turn">hook
    turns</a>, where you have to make right turns from the left lane when
    the traffic lights change. But not at every intersection, which is
    what makes them so confusing. In the rush of inner city traffic it’s
    easy to miss the signage and end up in the wrong lane for your turn.
    So how can you remember which intersections use hook turns?
  </p>
  <p>
    To answer this, we have to understand why hook turns exist at all.
    About half of the main streets in the CBD have tram tracks. Turning
    right from the right lane would require either sitting on the tram
    tracks blocking trams waiting for traffic to clear, or turning right
    with tram tracks on your inside lane and running the risk of getting
    t-boned by a tram. The purpose of the hook turn is to keep cars off
    the tram tracks. With this in mind, it’s easy to remember as you’re
    driving down a street with tram tracks that any right turn will be a
    hook turn, and the signs become merely confirmation rather than
    direction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good intentions don’t just help us understand the decisions of
    others. Have you ever looked at some code that looked wrong, wondered
    who could possibly have written it and why, run git blame and
    realised it was you. Two weeks ago. With the amount of context
    required to deeply understand parts of a system and the speed that we
    move from one thing to the next, the importance of being clear about
    intentions is critically important even when working alone. I find it
    safest to pretend that the me of two weeks into the past or future is
    for all intents and purposes a different person, and make sure to
    document my intentions appropriately.
  </p>
  <p>
    Decisions fall into one of these three types: <em>Start doing A</em>,
    <em>stop doing A</em>, or <em>A vs B (vs C vs …)</em>. You could
    argue that these are actually all just the same type, a choice
    between two (or more) things, but I like to distinguish between them
    because the frame of reference is important in the way choices are
    discussed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine that you have an API that, among other tasks, needs 
    to perform some operation which over time is starting to take longer
    and longer. Somebody on the team proposes putting a message onto
    Queue Service A so that this operation can be performed
    asynchronously. Somebody else on the team says this is a bad idea
    because Queue Service A doesn’t guarantee delivery, or because it
    might deliver twice, or some other attribute of Queue Service A
    specifically.
  </p>
  <p>
    This discussion can quickly devolve into an unproductive argument,
    when in reality they mostly agree with each other. The problem is
    that the first person is really arguing in favour of using any
    queuing service (<em>start doing A</em>). The second person is
    implicitly comparing Queue Service A to Queue Service B (<em>A vs
    B</em>), but their arguments against Queue Service A are perceived to
    be arguments against using a queuing service at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good intentions also help us avoid focusing on non-goals. When
    discussing a solution to a problem, it’s easy to conflate the
    positive attributes of the solution with our goals. This might not be
    a problem in the <em>start doing A</em> frame of reference, but can
    be extremely problematic with <em>A vs B</em>. It can mean that we
    start evaluating options not by how they compare to our requirements
    but by how they compare to each other, placing importance on
    attributes which aren’t relevant to our problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is especially bad if this misplaced importance on irrelevant
    attributes is perceived to outweigh other more important attributes
    and we end up selecting the worse option, possibly even worse than
    the alternative of not selecting either. This flaw in our decision
    making abilities, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring"
    >anchoring</a>, happens because of our frame of reference.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let’s look at some more concrete examples.
  </p>
  <p>
    Continuing with the theme of queuing services, here are some bullet
    points used to describe three different Azure services. “Build in
    resilience”, “Build reliable cloud applications”, “Build scalable
    cloud solutions”, “Scale for bursts”, “Simplify enterprise cloud
    messaging”, “Simplify event delivery”, “Implement complex messaging
    workflows”, “Decouple components”, “Focus on product innovation”. All
    of them sell me on the idea of using a queuing service to improve my
    application, against the alternative of not using any service at
    all—they sell me on <em>start doing A</em>. But once I’ve decided I
    need such a service, none of these helps me understand which one is
    right for my needs—<em>A vs B</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fortunately, there’s a page that directly compares two of these
    services—Storage queues and Service Bus queues. Unfortunately, it
    starts like this.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Azure supports two types of queue mechanisms: Storage queues and
      Service Bus queues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Storage queues, which are part of the Azure storage infrastructure,
      feature a simple REST-based GET/PUT/PEEK interface, providing
      reliable, persistent messaging within and between services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Service Bus queues are part of a broader Azure messaging
      infrastructure that supports queuing as well as publish/subscribe,
      and more advanced integration patterns. For more information about
      Service Bus queues/topics/subscriptions, see the overview of
      Service Bus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>While both queuing technologies exist concurrently, Storage
      queues were introduced first</em>, as a dedicated queue storage
      mechanism built on top of Azure Storage services.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Emphasis mine. That’s right. The main point of contrast apparently is
    that Storage queues called dibs first. To its credit, the article
    improves from here, and goes on to show an 11-point comparison table
    and says the following.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      As a solution architect/developer, you should consider using
      Storage queues when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>[3 bullet points omitted.]</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As a solution architect/developer, you should consider using
        Service Bus queues when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>[12 bullet points omitted.]</em></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    This is a discussion of queuing services in the <em>A vs B</em> frame
    of reference rather than <em>start doing A</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another example I like to give is the various Scrum ceremonies and
    techniques, like daily scrums / stand-ups, sprint retrospectives,
    story estimation and story slicing. Any team that calls itself
    “Agile” invariably does most or all of these things, but in my
    experience few ever stop to discuss their intentions in doing so,
    other than simply “being Agile”. They just go through the motions.
  </p>
  <p>
    This frequently leads to the people feeling that meetings are a
    mandatory yet valueless waste of time. They ask questions like
    “Should people from the business attend stand-up and retros?”
    “Should we skip stand-up if the Scrum master is on leave?”
    “Should stand-up go person-by-person or story-by-story?” They do
    story point estimation but aren’t sure exactly why. They ask
    questions like “Should we be estimating tasks, stories, features or
    epics?” “Should the value of an estimate depend on who is doing the
    work?” “Should estimates be adjusted after starting and realising
    there’s more involved than we thought?” They break down large
    stories, but ask questions like “Should we split stories into layers
    or vertical slices?” “Should the smaller chunks be stories or just
    tasks?”
  </p>
  <p>
    There are no right or wrong answers to these questions. Sure, some
    answers might work better for a majority of teams, but the point is
    that the right answer is the one that works best for your team. All
    of these techniques are supposed to work for you, to make you more
    productive. There’s little intrinsic value in going through the
    motions with these techniques. Unless you know what your intentions
    are, you can’t hope to realise much value from them. Take some time
    (in your retrospectives) to discuss as a team what you hope to
    achieve with each technique, and how you can get the most out of
    them. Don’t be afraid to try different approaches and see what works
    best for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the risk of getting too political, the final example I want to
    consider is government like the Australian parliament. The role of
    government is essentially to create legislation by prioritising the
    allocation of tax money and making trade-offs between liberty and
    regulation. Members need to state the intentions of each piece of
    legislation in order to get the necessary votes for it to pass, which
    usually involves some amount of debate and negotiation on various
    amendments. During an election campaign, the major parties state
    their intentions for government to the electorate in order to win
    support.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite this, the system as a whole is still prone to making the same
    kinds of mistakes about intentions as we are. Although there is often
    discussion about intentions at the micro-scale, at the level of
    individual pieces of legislation, broader intentions are less-well
    discussed. Elections are often said to be broadly about certain
    policy areas, but the discussion at this level is less robust, full
    of hand-waving, question-dodging and point-talking, and subject to
    media suppression and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window"
    >Overton window</a>. There is virtually no discussion about
    intentions above this level, outside of academic debate. People often
    refer to “traditional Australian values” but they aren’t well
    defined, policy is not assessed on how it furthers these values, and
    there are countless examples of policies that contradict the few
    values which are commonly agreed upon.
  </p>
  <p>
    One example of a breakdown of intentions in Australian politics is
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Australian_republic_referendum"
    >1999 Australian republic referendum</a>. There is a lot of analysis
    about how the framing of questions affects the outcome of
    referendums. Although it might seem like a <em>start doing A</em>
    question, where <em>A</em> is become a republic, it was worded in
    such a way that it opened up <em>A vs B</em> discussion.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      To alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of
      Australia as a republic with the Queen and Governor-General being
      replaced by a President appointed by a two-thirds majority of the
      members of the Commonwealth Parliament.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    This meant that many people in favour of becoming a republic voted no
    because they preferred a different method for appointing the
    president and were hopeful of another referendum in the near-future,
    and the referendum was ultimately voted down. Twenty-one years later 
    and it’s not clear whether that second referendum is coming.
  </p>
  <p>
    A more controversial example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"
    >Second Amendment</a>. I can’t even quote the text here, as there is
    debate about the correct punctuation and capitalisation which subtly
    affects the meaning (and assumed intention) of the amendment. Would
    the authors have intended for citizens to keep modern-day assault
    rifles? Would they still consider a well regulated militia necessary
    to the security of a free State, considering the vastly more powerful
    militaries? We’ll never know. People will continue to debate this for
    decades or centuries to come.
  </p>
  <p>
    So how can we be clearer about our intentions? Here are some
    techniques that might work for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first obvious step is to write comments in your code that explain
    not what it does but why it exists. What were your intentions when
    writing the code? What does it aim to achieve? Which bug does it
    solve? Which story does it implement? Links to external sources of
    context like this are a huge help to understanding and working with
    other people’s code—which remember means your own code two weeks
    after you write it. If you don’t want to leave these comments inline,
    consider making detailed commit messages instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    There’s another approach you can take to code comments. When somebody
    is trying to diagnose a bug and they see a suspicious piece of code,
    their instinct will be to delete it and their concern for making
    things worse will be the only thing stopping them. When you write
    tricky code, as well as explaining why it exists explain why it
    shouldn’t be deleted in the future. Or under what circumstances can
    it be deleted in the future. If you put in a fix to work around a bug
    in another part of the codebase, the fix can be removed when the
    other bug is fixed. If you don’t make this clear, people will be
    afraid to delete the code.
  </p>
  <p>
    There’s actually a great story that demonstrates this aversion to
    removing things—it’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton's_fence"
    >Chesterton’s fence</a>.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them,
      there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will
      probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain
      institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence
      or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer
      goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us
      clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will
      do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly
      won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can
      come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow
      you to destroy it.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The moral of the story is, always document the original use of
    something you add. When that use is no longer necessary, reformers
    will be more confident in clearing it away.
  </p>
  <p>
    There’s also a flipside to this, which is that sometimes people get
    hung up on what were originally arbitrary decisions. If you happen to
    make any arbitrary decisions in code that you write, like the value
    of a magic constant or the order of two operations, be clear about
    this and leave a comment saying it’s completely arbitrary.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you write a tool or a library that other people will use, it’s
    natural that you’ll write down all the strengths and advantages. But
    everything is a trade-off, and it’s far more likely that the person
    using your tool is thinking with an <em>A vs B</em> frame of
    reference than a <em>start doing A</em>. It’s important to be honest
    about these trade-offs and to also mention the weaknesses and
    disadvantages, so that your users can make informed decisions about
    what will best meet their requirements. If possible, provide direct
    comparisons with alternatives to make this even easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    Speaking of alternatives, when you are making decisions with several
    alternatives it’s good to document each one you considered and why
    you discounted them. If it was an <em>A vs B</em> decision but you
    only document the eventual selection (or nothing at all), later on
    you might look back and mistake it for a <em>start doing A</em>
    decision. If you later need to question or even change the decision,
    you’ll be better off for having access to the notes on what else was
    considered.
  </p>
  <p>
    Try to distinguish between problems and solutions. When a problem
    comes up and you think of an obvious solution to it, it can be all
    too easy to create a work item describing the solution and then get
    straight into it. If later on you need to change the solution and you
    didn’t properly document the problem, all alternative solutions will
    need to be compared against the existing solution. That is, you’ll be
    forced into an <em>A vs B</em> frame of reference rather than
    <em>start doing A</em>. This means that you might accidentally place
    importance on qualities of the existing solution which aren’t
    relevant to solving the original problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Actually, go one step further. When you’re documenting the problem be
    as clear as possible about the requirements that a solution needs to
    satisfy. Rather than saying “the solution needs to be fast”, say how
    fast it needs to be. Again, if later on you need to change the
    solution, you don’t want to discount alternatives just because they
    aren’t as fast as the current solution, if they still meet the
    original speed requirements. If it wasn’t your intention to pick the
    fastest possible solution, don’t accidentally fool your future self
    into thinking that it was.
  </p>
  <p>
    And finally, sometimes it helps to flip a <em>start doing A</em> into
    a <em>stop doing A</em> by pretending that you have already
    implemented the solution. I’ve often seen teams hold off on deploying
    a fix to a bug because it doesn’t solve the root problem, or it
    doesn’t fully mitigate the problem. This is the classic “perfect is
    the enemy of good” ideology at work, and it only results in
    unnecessary continued business impact until a fix is finally
    deployed. If you flipped the frame of reference and pretended that
    the fix was already deployed, you wouldn’t dream of taking it out and
    making the problem worse. Your intention when there is a live bug
    should be to mitigate the impact as quickly as possible, not
    necessarily to solve the root problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    My intention with this post has been to help you think more clearly
    about your intentions. To provide some examples of how clear
    intentions improve understanding and decision making, and unclear
    intentions cause confusion and bad decision making. And finally to
    provide some advice on how to be clearer in the way you think about
    and state your intentions. Actually that’s a lie. My real intention
    was to help me think more clearly about my intentions. If you’ve
    found any of this useful, that’s a bonus.
