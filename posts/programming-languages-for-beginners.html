    What’s the best/easiest programming language to learn for a beginner?
    I see this question asked all the time. Usually asked by people who
    want to get into programming, or maybe they’ve just finished learning
    the basics in their first language and are thinking about where to go
    next. It’s an innocent enough question and usually asked with good
    intentions, but it still bugs me every time I see it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The answers are never particularly helpful, but how could they be?
    There is no right answer. Some say you should start with a language
    like Python because it’s “easy” and you can learn programming
    concepts without fighting with the language as much as you would in
    “hard” languages, which is a perfectly valid point. Others say you
    should start with a language like C because it gives you great
    fundamentals and gives you better insight into what really happens
    behind the scenes, which is also a perfectly valid point. Others say
    you should start with a language like Java because its widely used in
    industry. All of these answers are equally valid which I feel makes
    them equally useless. Ultimately the right answer will be whatever
    works best for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I feel there’s a key point here which those answering the
    question understand but those asking it don’t, which is that really
    you should learn all three. The question always gives me the
    impression that the asker thinks programming languages are hard and
    they are hoping to just pick the “best” one and ignore all the
    others. And maybe they have tried to learn programming a couple of
    times in a couple of languages and found it difficult, and they
    assume that learning languages is hard. Those who have learnt a few
    languages quickly realise the distinction between learning a
    programming language and learning to program.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you haven’t had this realisation yet, think of programming like
    driving. When you first start learning to drive, you have to learn
    how the car handles, how the pedals feel, where the blind spots are,
    where the boundaries of your car are, when to break before a corner,
    what a good speed feels like, how far behind the car in front you
    should be. And at the same time you have to learn the road rules. If
    you’ve ever tried changing cars early in the learning stage, you’ll
    remember the feeling where everything is just a bit off. You’re so
    focused on what the guy in front is doing, that when you put on the
    brakes you forget that they’re more sensitive in the new car and you
    come to a screeching halt.
  </p>
  <p>
    Changing programming languages early on can feel a lot like this too.
    But once you feel comfortable driving, the road rules are all second
    nature, you monitor those around you subconsciously with your
    peripherals, changing cars is easy. Maybe it handles a bit
    differently, the pedals feel different, but you adapt quickly. If
    somebody asked you “I want to be a professional driver, what car
    should I learn to drive in?” you’d think they were stupid. It doesn’t
    make a difference, driving is driving. Cars are tools for driving,
    and programming languages are tools for programming.
  </p>
  <p>
    So back to my point earlier, that really you should learn all three.
    The reason is not because knowing more languages looks better on your
    résumé, or because it gives you more potential for work, but because
    it makes you a better programmer. Learn the easy language which lets
    you try new things quickly without fighting with the language. Learn
    the low-level language and all the dirty hacks and one-liners that
    give you a better understanding of what goes on behind the scenes.
    Learn the heavy duty language which helps you build large systems in
    a more manageable way.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the reason you wanted to get into programming was to make fun
    little programs and automate stuff, maybe the easy language is best
    for you to start with. If the reason you wanted to get into
    programming was to learn how computers work, maybe the low-level
    language is the best for you to start with. If the reason you wanted
    to get into programming was to build something big, maybe the robust
    language is best for you to start with. Start with whatever helps
    keep you motivated, because staying motivated is one of the hardest
    parts of learning anything. But once you feel confident in that first
    language, don’t stop. Be curious! Because curiosity is the key to
    pushing the boundaries of your comfort zone, and ultimately to
    expanding your knowledge.
