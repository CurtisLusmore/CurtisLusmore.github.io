          What’s the best/easiest programming language to learn for a beginner?
          I see this question asked all the time. Usually asked by people who
          want to get into programming, or maybe they’ve just finished learning
          the basics in their first language and are thinking about where to go
          next. It’s an innocent enough question and usually asked with good
          intentions, but it still bugs me every time I see it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The answers are never particularly helpful, but how could they be?
          There is no right answer. Some say you should start with a language
          like Python because it’s “easy” and you can learn programming
          concepts without fighting with the language as much as you would in
          “hard” languages, which is a perfectly valid point. Others say you
          should start with a language like C because it gives you great
          fundamentals and gives you better insight into what really happens
          behind the scenes, which is also a perfectly valid point. Others say
          you should start with a language like Java because its widely used in
          industry. All of these answers are equally valid which I feel makes
          them equally useless. Ultimately the right answer will be whatever
          works best for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I feel there’s a key point here which those answering the
          question understand but those asking it don’t, which is that really
          you should learn all three. The question always gives me the
          impression that the asker thinks programming languages are hard and
          they are hoping to just pick the “best” one and ignore all the
          others. And maybe they have tried to learn programming a couple of
          times in a couple of languages and found it difficult, and they
          assume that learning languages is hard. Those who have learnt a few
          languages quickly realise the distinction between learning a
          programming language and learning to program.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you haven’t had this realisation yet, think of programming like
          driving. When you first start learning to drive, you have to learn
          how the car handles, how the pedals feel, where the blind spots are,
          where the boundaries of your car are, when to break before a corner,
          what a good speed feels like, how far behind the car in front you
          should be. And at the same time you have to learn the road rules. If
          you’ve ever tried changing cars early in the learning stage, you’ll
          remember the feeling where everything is just a bit off. You’re so
          focused on what the guy in front is doing, that when you put on the
          brakes you forget that they’re more sensitive in the new car and you
          come to a screeching halt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Changing programming languages early on can feel a lot like this too.
          But once you feel comfortable driving, the road rules are all second
          nature, you monitor those around you subconsciously with your
          peripherals, changing cars is easy. Maybe it handles a bit
          differently, the pedals feel different, but you adapt quickly. If
          somebody asked you “I want to be a professional driver, what car
          should I learn to drive in?” you’d think they were stupid. It doesn’t
          make a difference, driving is driving. Cars are tools for driving,
          and programming languages are tools for programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          So back to my point earlier, that really you should learn all three.
          The reason is not because knowing more languages looks better on your
          résumé, or because it gives you more potential for work, but because
          it makes you a better programmer. Learn the easy language which lets
          you try new things quickly without fighting with the language. Learn
          the low-level language and all the dirty hacks and one-liners that
          give you a better understanding of what goes on behind the scenes.
          Learn the heavy duty language which helps you build large systems in
          a more manageable way.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the reason you wanted to get into programming was to make fun
          little programs and automate stuff, maybe the easy language is best
          for you to start with. If the reason you wanted to get into
          programming was to learn how computers work, maybe the low-level
          language is the best for you to start with. If the reason you wanted
          to get into programming was to build something big, maybe the robust
          language is best for you to start with. Start with whatever helps
          keep you motivated, because staying motivated is one of the hardest
          parts of learning anything. But once you feel confident in that first
          language, don’t stop. Be curious! Because curiosity is the key to
          pushing the boundaries of your comfort zone, and ultimately to
          expanding your knowledge.
