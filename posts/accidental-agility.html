    Today marks the 18th anniversary of the final day of the meeting at
    Snowbird which ultimately lead to the creation of the
    <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile software development
    manifesto</a>. If it were a person, it’d be at the legal drinking age
    (here in Australia). And it has a lot to celebrate, it’s come a long
    way in that time. What started as scribblings on a blackboard in a
    meeting of seventeen programmers has since grown to take the business
    world by storm. Some would even say it’s grown out of control
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M">(some of the
    original authors, no less)</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this post, I want to rediscover the essence of agility by looking
    at an example of an industry that exhibits the principles outlined in
    the original manifesto, despite not even being aware of it. This
    essentially means that they have independently discovered the ideas
    of agile development, but because they missed the surrounding hype,
    they’ve managed to avoid a lot of the unnecessary baggage that tends
    to follow “Agile” in practice. My goal is to make people refocus on
    what is really important and valuable about agile software
    development, and see past the noise that has built up around it.
  </p>
  <p>
    So first, let’s just remind ourselves of the original text in the
    manifesto.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it
      and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
    </p>
    <p>
      Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<br>
      Working software over comprehensive documentation<br>
      Customer collaboration over contract negotiation<br>
      Responding to change over following a plan
    </p>
    <p>
      That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value
      the items on the left more.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Some of these points are quite specific to the software industry, so
    in order to think about these ideas in the context of another
    industry we need to peel back that specificity and get at the more
    general concepts underneath. Let’s look at each clause.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Individuals and interactions over processes and tools: It’s more
      important to hire the best people and give them the freedom to
      explore and be creative, than to define guard-rail processes that
      try to guide people towards “the right thing.”
    </li>
    <li>
      Working software over comprehensive documentation: Value and the
      measure of progress are both defined in terms of working “product”
      in the hands of your users, whatever that might be in your case.
      The philosophy of delivering value early and often follows on from
      this, and one of the key benefits is that the project still
      delivers value even if the deadline is not met or cut short.
    </li>
    <li>
      Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: Your customer
      requirements will change over time. This isn’t necessarily because
      they’re fickle, it’s purely because it’s not until you get
      “product” into their hands that they know if it’s any good. You
      need to work with them rather than trying to force them to freeze
      their requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
      Responding to change over following a plan: If the above change
      wasn’t enough, the environment is changing around you all the time.
      Budgets change, timelines change, your team changes, the world
      changes. The unknown unknowns will kill you if you aren’t flexible
      to change.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Now, keeping this all in mind, I want to take a look at the film and
    TV industry by trying to re-interpret the manifesto in this context.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
        The first clause can be interepreted to mean that the talent is
        more important than the formula, and we see this play out where
        B-grade shows and movies tend to follow fairly formulaic plots
        whereas A-graders tend to rely more on hiring the biggest stars
        and giving them a bit more creative licence to influence the
        characters or the story.
    </li>
    <li>
      The second clause can be interpreted to mean that no amount of gut
      feel or market research will tell you which scripts are going to be
      winners, you need to produce something and let the viewing public
      judge for themselves. This is why TV shows have pilots, and why TV
      and movie series are renewed in pieces rather than backed for their
      full runs initially. Another benefit of this approach is that the
      profits of one season or film can be re-invested to fund the next.
    </li>
    <li>
      The third clause is almost non-applicable in its obviousness.
      Production companies can’t negotiate with their customers—the
      audience—they can only create a two-way “dialogue” whereby they
      produce content and the audience provides feedback, in the form of
      tweets and dollars at the box office, which then feeds back into
      the production of the next installment.
    </li>
    <li>
      The fourth clause can be interpreted exactly as is. The only
      constant is change. Your cast will change, your crew will change,
      audience tastes will change, the characters will change. I’ve never
      heard of a TV show that was able to successfully plan out the plot
      for the entire run before producing the first episode, and actually
      stick to it, and you’d be crazy to try anyway. Hell, they planned
      to kill Jesse Pinkman in season one but thankfully changed their
      minds on that one.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    One thing that’s interesting to note about this example is that it
    doesn’t require that individual films or TV seasons be produced
    using typical agile process. Instead, the philosophy of agile software
    development is being used as a higher-level process. If you translate
    this back to the “real world of Agile”, we actually see parallels
    with Scrum. A sprint is not far off a mini project, deliberately
    scoped to a small timebox to reduce the amount of contained risk and
    then planned up-front, with parts of the agile philosophy only really
    applying at the level above this in the transitions between sprints.
  </p>
  <p>
    But it’s important to remember that the mere act of breaking work up
    into sprints isn’t inherently agile. The benefits come from
    delivering working software at regular intervals, getting feedback
    from customers or users, using that feedback to course-correct from
    the next sprint onwards, and taking a moment to reflect on your work
    processes and whether they are helping you to get the best out of
    your team. It’s all too easy to blindly <a
    href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm">cargo
    cult</a> the day-to-day activities of “Agile” and think that the
    benefits will naturally follow, allowing the day-to-day activities to
    become the goal. They aren’t the goal, and it always helps to look to
    other industries for inspiration on how they are solving the same set
    of problems.
