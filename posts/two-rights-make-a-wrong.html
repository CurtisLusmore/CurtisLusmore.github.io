    A few years ago I came across this awesome post,
    <a href="https://medium.com/intigriti/how-i-hacked-hundreds-of-companies-through-their-helpdesk-b7680ddc2d4c"
    >How I hacked hundreds of companies through their helpdesk</a>, which
    describes a neat hack on a whole bunch of companies. I encourage you to
    read the full post because it’s a fascinating read, but I’ll summarise the
    gist of it here.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some work apps, the most common example being Slack, allow you to register
    and sign in with any email address on your employer’s domain, e.g.
    anything@<wbr>company.com. This is a convenience that allows your employees
    to self-service register without allowing just anybody in. This sounds safe
    enough to a lot of companies, because they figure they only give out these
    email addresses to current employees.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many apps with support systems, the example from the post being GitLab,
    will assign customers an email address, like some-random-id@<wbr
    >company.com, that they can email to create a support ticket. Since
    basically everything can send email, this is a handy way of integrating
    with a bunch of apps quickly. Again, this sounds safe enough because we
    don’t generally think of access to a throwaway email address as providing
    access to critical systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    In isolation, each of these ideas sounds great. But as you’ve probably
    already spotted, the combination is a catastrophe. The author was able to
    join GitLab’s private Slack instance by signing up with his assigned
    support email address.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are other examples in the infosec space, like websites that will hide
    all but the last few digits of your credit card number or social security
    number, and others that use this information as proof-of-identity during an
    account recovery process. The combination here means that if somebody gains
    access to one of your accounts they might be able to leverage information
    it leaks to access other accounts.
  </p>
  <p>
    There’s another example that I noticed during COVID-19, though perhaps not
    as extreme. The <a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/news-events/news/sneezing-101-what-why-how-to-sneeze-correctly-safely"
    >Sneezing 101</a> page on the QLD Government website says you should sneeze
    into your elbow, which makes sense since you don’t want to get your hands
    dirty and then spread the germs onto everything you touch.  However, the
    <a href="https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/covid-19-transport/automation-of-pedestrian-crossing-signals-at-intersections"
    >Automation of pedestrian crossing signals at intersections</a> page on the
    QLD Government website says you should press pedestrian crossing buttons
    with your elbow, which also makes sense since you don’t want germs to
    spread from the button to your hands.
  </p>
  <p>
    But think about the combination of doing <em>both</em> of these things
    together. Is it safe to sneeze into my elbow and then use it to press
    buttons at pedestrian crossings, elevators, or to pull door handles? Is it
    safe to bury my head into the elbow that I just used to press all those
    buttons? Again, individually both of these ideas sound great, but they
    don’t work together in combination. I picked on the QLD Gov website here
    because it happened to be the top search result, but I have seen the same
    suggestions dozens of times over the last year.
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, neither piece of advice is bad and I’m certainly not suggesting
    either be changed or retracted, but in combination they can lead to an
    undesirable or unintended outcome. In other cases, such as the exploit
    described in the article I linked above, you absolutely do need to change
    one or the other, and because both are individually good ideas it’s not
    always clear which to change.
