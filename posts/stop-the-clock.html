    My watch has this neat feature where it automatically keeps the time and
    date synchronised via a radio signal. For the most part it works
    flawlessly, and I haven’t had to worry about setting the time in all the
    years I’ve had it, even when I accidentally starve it of sunlight to charge
    and its battery dies. A short walk outside and it’s back up and running in
    no time, back to the correct time again.
  </p>
  <p>
    But one morning recently I noticed it had started to run about two
    minutes fast, and in trying to manually set the time I learnt a valuable
    lesson that I think is informative far beyond just my watch.
  </p>
  <p>
    I pulled out the instructions manual and found the section on manually
    setting the time. Pull out the dial on the side to change mode, and then
    press a little button to advance forward by one minute—<wbr>there is no
    button to rewind a minute. It’s a twelve-hour watch, I need to advance by …
    seven-hundred and eighteen minutes. Mercifully, you can just hold down the
    button to continue advancing.
  </p>
  <p>
    After several minutes of the hands whizzing around it went past noon, and I
    notice the little day-of-month indicator panel. Oh yeah, it <em>is</em> a
    twenty-four hour watch. Okay that’s … one-thousand four-hundred and
    thirty-eight minutes. The hands continue whizzing by. No wait, once I go
    forward a day then the day-of-month indicator will be wrong. I need to go
    forward an entire month? There’s no month indicator. But that’s … a lot of
    minutes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hands continue whizzing by as I think, but I haven’t even advanced a
    single day yet. Wait wait wait, I can’t advance a month because not every
    month has the same number of days. There’s no 31st of November. So, a whole
    year then? Still the hands continue to whiz by but the finish line is
    getting further and further away.
  </p>
  <p>
    By this point it’s clear to me that this isn’t the correct way to adjust
    the watch backwards two minutes. I have probably been going for ten minutes
    already and goal has blown out from twelve hours to a whole year, but now I
    can’t stop my brain from going down the rabbit hole thinking about whether
    this will ever even work. I can’t do a year because there are leap years
    every four years. Except they aren’t every four years because they don’t
    happen every hundred years but they do happen every four-hundred years. How
    many minutes are there in four-hundred years?
  </p>
  <p>
    Enough! Stop wasting time, there has to be another way.
  </p>
  <p>
    I check the manual again but this time to follow the instructions to
    synchronise with the radio signal, and after a few more minutes of the
    hands whizzing around I’m back where I started, two minutes fast and about
    fifteen minutes of my life gone.
  </p>
  <p>
    I pull the dial out again and then pause to think. There is another button,
    but it doesn’t do anything in this mode. I can’t see anything else on the
    watch besides the dial and the forwards button. I start to wonder if maybe
    the dial has another setting for a backwards mode, when I notice that the
    hands are paused. It’s been paused the whole time. I’ve been thinking for a
    minute, and now my watch is only one minute fast. If I just wait one more
    minute, it’ll be right.
  </p>
  <p>
    So in the end, after fifteen minutes spent madly rushing forwards with no
    plan, with the finish line only getting further and further away the more I
    chase it, I achieved absolutely nothing and had to reset and start over
    again. What was really needed was to pause, understand the situation
    properly, wait for the right moment, and then the solution was trivial.
