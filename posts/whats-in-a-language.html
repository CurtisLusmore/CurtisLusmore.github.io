    <a href="#1">What’s the purpose of a programming language?</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    A programming language is an interface between humans and computers,
    that allows us to program computers to perform some task. The purpose
    of the task is usually to solve some particular problem that the
    human has. Most languages are <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing
    complete</a>, which essentially means that they are mostly all
    equivalent. So what’s the point of creating a new programming
    language if it’s equivalent to ones that already exist? Turing
    completeness means that languages are equivalent in terms of the
    programs they are able to express, but it says nothing about the
    journey of getting to the finished program.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you think hard enough about your problem, there are probably some
    soft requirements that go along with it as well. The solution might
    require one or more of the following properties:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>it should be flexible to changing requirements,</li>
    <li>it should perform quickly,</li>
    <li>it should be reliable,</li>
    <li>it should be quick or cheap to develop,</li>
    <li>it should be provably correct.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    How much you prioritise each of these properties should influence
    your choice of language, and language designers should know which
    properties they are trying to optimise for. While most languages are
    functionally equivalent to each other, new langauges are created all
    the time because they are supposedly better at one or more of these
    properties than all others.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point I think it’s important to note the difference between a
    language and an implementation of a language. Many programming
    languages have only one standard implementation (a compiler or
    interpreter) and the language is often used interchangably with the
    implementation in conversation. But the two are very much distinct,
    any many of the properties listed above apply more to the
    implementation of a language than to the language itself.
    Performance, for example, is much more dependent on the
    implementation than the language itself. Some languages are designed
    to be easy to implement efficiently, others are designed without
    considering performance at all. But still, it makes no sense to
    compare the performance of languages themselves—<wbr>only of their
    implementations. As such, we will only consider properties of
    languages, not of their implementations.

  <p>
    What properties of a solution or the journey towards creating a
    solution are desirable, and how might a programming langauge help us
    optimise these properties? Let’s consider the typical stages in the
    lifecycle of a program:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>design,</li>
    <li>implementation,</li>
    <li>verification</li>
    <li>execution</li>
    <li>maintenance.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The stages can occur sequentially or in a continuous feedback loop,
    but this is irrelevant for our discussion. The properties that are
    desirable for a language are essentially those which make these five
    stages easier, faster, more accurate, more reliable, or perhaps more
    enjoyable. Again, we should consider which of these stages is most
    important to us when choosing or designing a programming language.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most developer use a software development process or methodology,
    such as <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
    >test-driven development</a>, <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate
    programming</a> or <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinement_%28computing%29"
    >refinement</a>. At the language level, in order to bring formal
    structure to the development process, many use one or more
    programming paradigms, like <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming"
    >object-oriented programming</a> or <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"
    >functional programming</a>. And even lower than this, there are
    countless design principles, patterns and idioms. All of these should
    be considered when choosing or designing a programming language.
