          <a href="#1">What’s the purpose of a programming language?</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          A programming language is an interface between humans and computers,
          that allows us to program computers to perform some task. The purpose
          of the task is usually to solve some particular problem that the
          human has. Most languages are <a target="_blank"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing
          complete</a>, which essentially means that they are mostly all
          equivalent. So what’s the point of creating a new programming
          language if it’s equivalent to ones that already exist? Turing
          completeness means that languages are equivalent in terms of the
          programs they are able to express, but it says nothing about the
          journey of getting to the finished program.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you think hard enough about your problem, there are probably some
          soft requirements that go along with it as well. The solution might
          require one or more of the following properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>it should be flexible to changing requirements,</li>
          <li>it should perform quickly,</li>
          <li>it should be reliable,</li>
          <li>it should be quick or cheap to develop,</li>
          <li>it should be provably correct.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          How much you prioritise each of these properties should influence
          your choice of language, and language designers should know which
          properties they are trying to optimise for. While most languages are
          functionally equivalent to each other, new langauges are created all
          the time because they are supposedly better at one or more of these
          properties than all others.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point I think it’s important to note the difference between a
          language and an implementation of a language. Many programming
          languages have only one standard implementation (a compiler or
          interpreter) and the language is often used interchangably with the
          implementation in conversation. But the two are very much distinct,
          any many of the properties listed above apply more to the
          implementation of a language than to the language itself.
          Performance, for example, is much more dependent on the
          implementation than the language itself. Some languages are designed
          to be easy to implement efficiently, others are designed without
          considering performance at all. But still, it makes no sense to
          compare the performance of languages themselves—only of their
          implementations. As such, we will only consider properties of
          languages, not of their implementations.
        </p>
        <h2 id="2">
          <a href="#2">Properties of languages</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          What properties of a solution or the journey towards creating a
          solution are desirable, and how might a programming langauge help us
          optimise these properties? Let’s consider the typical stages in the
          lifecycle of a program:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>design,</li>
          <li>implementation,</li>
          <li>verification</li>
          <li>execution</li>
          <li>maintenance.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The stages can occur sequentially or in a continuous feedback loop,
          but this is irrelevant for our discussion. The properties that are
          desirable for a language are essentially those which make these five
          stages easier, faster, more accurate, more reliable, or perhaps more
          enjoyable. Again, we should consider which of these stages is most
          important to us when choosing or designing a programming language.

          Most developer use a software development process or methodology,
          such as <a target="_blank"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">
          test-driven development</a>, <a target="_blank"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate
          programming</a> or <a target="_blank"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinement_%28computing%29">
          refinement</a>. At the language level, in order to bring formal
          structure to the development process, many use one or more
          programming paradigms, like <a target="_blank"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">
          object-oriented programming</a> or <a target="_blank"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">
          functional programming</a>. And even lower than this, there are
          countless design principles, patterns and idioms. All of these should
          be considered when choosing or designing a programming language.
