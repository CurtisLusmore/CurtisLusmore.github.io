    100 days ago, on 16th January, I started a public blogging streak on
    Twitter. At that point, it had been 232 days since my last post and I was
    suffering from writer’s block. My goal was not to post every day or even
    every week, but just to force myself to make some progress towards a post
    each day by thinking of a topic, bashing out a few points in a Twitter
    thread, drafting or actually (eventually) posting.
  </p>
  <p>
    This isn’t my first attempt at an activity streak. I’ve previously written
    about my <a href="/posts/199-days-of-git">199 Days of Git</a>, and late
    last year I attempted 100 days of meditation publicly on Twitter to mixed
    success. In the end, I posted to Twitter on 70 of the 100 days and added
    12 posts (including this one) to my blog. Now that it’s come to an end,
    it’s time to reflect on the experience, so here are my top five lessons
    learnt.
  </p>
  <p>
    1. It’s much less intimdating to Tweet than to blog. A Twitter thread
    doesn’t need a title, a snappy introduction or even a coherent point. I
    found it was surprisingly easy to bash out ten or so Tweets on a topic
    which would ultimately form the basis of a post, whilst still giving me a
    few days to mull it over further, change my mind, think of other points or
    examples, tweak the framing if necessary, and come up with a title and the
    introduction (which I always find the hardest parts of blogging). The only
    downside with starting in Twitter is that you’re forced into 280 character
    paragraphs, which means you can probably tell from the frequency of
    paragraph breaks which of my posts started in Twitter.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. History repeats itself. Over the last 100 days there were several
    occasions where I referred back to something I had recently posted because
    the topic came up in conversation, or I experienced another situation just
    like one I had written about. In each case I was glad that I had recently
    dived into the topic for my blog, because it meant I had thought something
    through more clearly than I might have otherwise and could contribute to a
    conversation better, or because I was able to just refer somebody directly
    to the post. Maybe it’s just a form of confirmation bias, but I think the
    same handful of problems do come up over and over again in slightly
    different forms, and it helps to have your thoughts at the ready.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. I actually have plenty of ideas for topics. At some point after the last
    post published before the streak, I started collecting topic ideas in a
    folder. By the time I started the streak, I had 32 topic ideas. Despite
    publishing 12 posts and having 5 drafts yet to post, I still have 32 ideas
    left on my list. It seems that the process of thinking really hard about a
    topic as required to write a post on it is also a pretty effective process
    for discovering further topics. If lack of topic ideas is the only thing
    keeping you from blogging, hit me up and I’ll happily give you some
    suggestions if it’ll help.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Quantity over quality. I used to stress about this a lot, agonising over
    each topic on my list whether it was truly worthy of its own blog post.
    I’ve since discovered that it’s really hard to know which topics will turn
    into interesting posts until you write them. I spent a bit of time during
    this streak going back through the archives of some of my favourite
    bloggers and realised that they had a lot of forgettable posts too, which
    is perfectly okay, because in that heap of posts are some real gems that
    have stuck with me for years. Jeff Atwood made this point already in his
    post <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/quantity-always-trumps-quality/"
    >Quantity Always Trumps Quality</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Habits create reinforcing loops. When I wasn’t posting, every day it was
    easy to think that today wasn’t going to be the day to start. But once you
    get into the rhythm of posting frequently, this flips completely on its
    head, and you start to that today shouldn’t be the day to stop. I certainly
    wasn’t perfect, as evidenced by the fact that I only Tweeted 70 of the 100
    days, including 9 consecutive days without a Tweet. But by the end I
    settled into a weekly cadence of starting a topic on Monday, drafting
    throughout the week, publishing on Thursday, and then giving myself the
    weekend off.
  </p>
  <p>
    So now that the 100 days are up, what’s next? I think I’ll continue
    more-or-less as I have been, with a Twitter thread at the start of the week
    followed by a post on Thursdays, just without the pointless Tweets
    throughout the week saying that I’m still drafting. I still have plenty of
    topics on my list, and hopefully I continue to find more topics as I think
    harder about the ones already on my list.
