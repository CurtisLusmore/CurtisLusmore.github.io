          May 20, 2016. My Git streak comes to an abrupt end on 199 days.
          Today, GitHub disabled the commit streak feature and left me stranded
          one day short of a milestone. It feels a little frustrating to get so
          close and then have it taken away, but in the end the overwhelming
          feeling is actually one of relief.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m a chronic procrastinator and a prolific sidetracker—I’ve always
          had trouble following through on things after the initial whirl of
          enthusiastic development dies down. More often than not, it’s not so
          much that I get bored of the project I’m working, it’s that I get
          distracted by something else more exciting. I’ve tried lots of
          different approaches to improve this, but haven’t had much success.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to keep my code entirely offline on my computer in a horrible
          mess of poorly named “temporary” directories, so whenever I decided
          to go back to an old project I would have no idea where it was up to,
          if I could even find it. So invariably I would just start over again.
          Clearly this isn’t the way to go—something had to change so I decided
          to start putting all of my projects on GitHub. The hope was that
          having it publicly visible would encourage me to actually complete
          some of them. And being in a state where I was perpetually restarting
          projects made me feel like, despite the fact that I spent most of my
          free time developing something, I couldn’t actually list anything I’d
          actually accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then I came across the Git commit streak on GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          This one number shows me how many days in a row I’ve done some amount
          of work on one of my projects. It doesn’t matter if every day I work
          on something different, as long as I work on something the number
          continues to go up. So I decided to see how far I could take it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as with all of my projects, it started with a brief spurt of
          activity. I made a few commits each day over the first weekend, but
          then it quickly dropped back to one commit a day during the week. For
          my day job I write proprietary software so I don’t get any credit for
          that—my commits all came from side projects after hours. And I
          quickly found that the longer it went on, the harder it was to find
          something to commit each day.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can imagine, there were more than a few in there that were
          mostly just cleanup or adding comments. Hey, it’s an easy commit and
          I figure that if keeping the streak going encourages me to do some
          cleanup that I might not otherwise have done, that’s only a good
          thing. At least I’m thinking about the projects every day and making
          some small contribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then it really started to get hard. Some days after committing some
          code I would deliberately leave some more to commit the next day.
          Some days I would be up at 11:30pm, exhausted and desperately wanting
          to sleep, trawling through my repos looking for low-hanging fruit so
          I could commit something and go to bed. Luckily, my partner was
          really supportive of me—I remember one time she put a fight on hold
          for me so that I could make a last-minute commit just before
          midnight. The 100 day milestone came up while I was on holiday, still
          committing some code each day in between spending time with my
          partner’s family.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that’s not the worst of it. The moment I truly realised that the
          commit streak was starting to control me was not when I thought about
          the things that it made me do, but the things that it made me not do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right from the start, I decided to start blogging alongside growing
          my streak and chose to host my blog as a GitHub page so that blogging
          counted as a contribution. I could have gone with Jekyll, but I
          decided to roll my own blog with hand-written JavaScript as a
          learning exercise. And sure enough, it gave me an excuse to get some
          easy commits by tweaking the blog a bit or adding some features. But
          it was so tedious, I had some things I wanted to blog about but
          didn’t because hand-writing the markup for the posts was so painful
          (I never did get around to writing that markdown parser or syntax
          highlighter).
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually I started posting on other platforms, and only continued
          to post on my GitHub page because I would get contributions for it.
          Actually, the only reason I didn’t delete the GitHub page was because
          I would lose past contributions for it. And then I realised I have a
          few other repos on my GitHub that I only created to get a few easy
          commits out of, but that never lead anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to delete them, but I couldn’t.
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth is, I’ve wanted to end my streak for a few months now. More
          than once I’ve sat there at 11:45pm with no commits, thinking
          “today’s the day I finally do it”. But I always talked myself out of
          it—or actually a few times my partner talked me out of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now that it’s been taken away for me, I feel a huge weight lifted
          off my shoulders. I don’t have to be enslaved by the number any more.
          I can go on committing code when I feel like it. And sure, that’ll
          probably still end up being most days, but perhaps some days I’ll
          have something better to do. And I can finally delete those useless
          repos now. Actually I imagine that by the time you read this, if you
          check my GitHub profile my streak will be broken up from deletions.
