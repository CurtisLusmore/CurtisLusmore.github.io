          This is a technique that I discovered several years ago while
          teaching an introductory programming course, and I was extremely
          pleased to find out that although it had already been discovered, I
          had given it the same name. <a target="_blank"
          href="http://dsoguy.blogspot.com/2007/01/programming-by-wishful-thinking.html">
          Programming by wishful thinking</a> is a style of top-down
          program design that helps you improve the structure of your code,
          isolate the hairy parts from the simple parts, think more clearly
          about data flow, and work faster. I find it particularly helpful for
          novice programmers who feel intimidated when starting a new project
          and aren’t sure how to get started, but I still practise it regularly
          as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          So how does it work? I think this might be easiest to demonstrate by
          example. Let’s imagine that you are trying to write a Python program
          that checks the <a target="_blank"
          href="https://www.xkcd.com/rss.xml">xkcd RSS feed</a> and downloads
          new comics. In a bottom-up design, we can think about the different
          built-in functions of Python and its standard library that we could
          use. We’ll need to make a web request to the RSS feed, parse XML,
          download images, sounds pretty complicated. Wouldn’t it be great if
          Python had a few more built-ins, and we could just do this?
        </p>
        <pre class="python">
items = fetch_rss('https://www.xkcd.com/rss.xml')
for item in items:
    src = get_img_from_item(item)
    download_image(src)
</pre>
        <p>
          We’d be done! Although Python is a <a target="_blank"
          href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0206/">batteries
          included</a> language, it unfortunately doesn’t include these
          functions. That’s okay though, because we can just define each of
          these functions. Let’s start with <code>fetch_rss</code>. This is
          definitely going to involve a web request, so we should figure out
          which library to use. Then we’ll need an XML parser to convert the
          response into a list of items. Sounds pretty complicated, and I
          really just want to download some images. Can we come back to this
          later?
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, let’s just fake it. At the time of publication, the xkcd RSS
          feed contains the following four comics: <a target="_blank"
          href="https://xkcd.com/2100/">Models of the Atom</a>, <a
          target="_blank" href="https://xkcd.com/2099/">Missal of Silos</a>, <a
          target="_blank" href="https://xkcd.com/2098/">Magnetic Pole</a>, and
          <a target="_blank" href="https://xkcd.com/2098/">Thor Tools</a>. So
          we know that if we were to actually implement <code>fetch_rss</code>
          and run it right now, those are the results we’d get.
        </p>
        <pre class="python">
def fetch_rss(url):
    return [
        'https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/models_of_the_atom.png',
        'https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/missal_of_silos.png',
        'https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/magnetic_pole.png',
        'https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/thor_tools.png'
    ]
</pre>
        <p>
          There we go. Good enough for now. Next up,
          <code>get_img_from_item</code>. This is supposed to extract from one
          of the items in the result of <code>fetch_rss</code> the URL of the
          image to download. Well that’s easy, because each item in the result
          already is that URL.
        </p>
        <pre>
def get_img_from_item(item):
    return item
</pre>
        <p>
          The last function to implement is <code>download_image</code>. We
          actually care about this one working properly, because I actually
          want to view the images on my harddrive. We don’t have much choice
          but to implement it properly. We can use <code><a target="_blank"
          href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.urlretrieve">
          urllib.request.urlretrieve</a></code> for this, but we need to
          specify the target filename. Let’s just use more wishful thinking and
          move on.
        </p>
        <pre class="python">
from urllib.request import urlretrieve
def download_image(src):
    dst = generate_filename(src)
    urlretrieve(src, dst)
</pre>
        <p>
          I said the previous function was the last function, but we’ve shifted
          the goalposts now by introducing yet another imaginary function. No
          problem, we can implement it too. For now, we’ll just stick the
          download into the working directory using whatever filename the
          source URL uses (get the last element in the path). Maybe in the
          future we’ll want something a bit better than this, but since we’ve
          tucked it away in its own function it’s completely isolated and we
          can easily come back and change it.
        </p>
        <pre>
def generate_filename(url):
    return url.split('/')[-1]
</pre>
        <p>
          Put it all together in a single file (in the right order), run it,
          and sure enough I have four comics to view locally. From
          <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast">
          Make it Work, Make it Right, Make it Fast</a>, we’ve made it work,
          now it’s time to make it right by going back and properly
          implementing the functions we skipped over.
        </p>
        <pre class="python">
from urllib.request import urlopen
from xml.etree import ElementTree
def fetch_rss(url):
    src = urlopen(url).read()
    xml = ElementTree.fromstring(src)
    return xml.findall('channel/item')
</pre>
        <p>
          By correctly implementing <code>fetch_rss</code>, we have changed the
          return value and thereby broken <code>get_img_from_item</code>, so we
          should implement it now too.
        </p>
        <pre class="python">
def get_img_from_item(item):
    desc = item.find('description').text
    html = ElementTree.fromstring(desc)
    return html.get('src')
</pre>
        <p>
          And now we’ve made it right. The approach we have just followed
          pretty accurately reflects the actual process I use when developing
          software. Here’s why.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Getting to a working solution as quickly as possible is
            hugely motivating.</li>
          <li>Helps me to think about the structure of the code first, and
            worry about implementation details later.</li>
          <li>Forces me to think about data flow early, by identifying the
            required parameters and return values of each function, and the
            links between successive function calls.</li>
          <li>Helps to isolate the hairier parts of the task in well-specified
            functions, decreasing coupling with the main program body and
            making it easier to change or improve the implementations later
            without breaking things.
          </li>
          <li>The hard-coded implementations can easily be converted to unit
            tests.</li>
        </ul>
