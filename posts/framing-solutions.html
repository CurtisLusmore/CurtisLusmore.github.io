    I was working on a Scrum project where the user stories always ended up
    being too big to fit into a sprint, and we were constantly half-finishing
    stories and carrying them over to the next sprint. Our team agreed we
    needed to split the stories up, but we couldn’t agree how.
  </p>
  <p>
    The team proposed we split stories into front-end and back-end components.
    This is a common way of splitting up work, because it’s obvious, it’s easy
    to do, and it’s easy to then assign the smaller stories to those with the
    right skills. I proposed instead we use vertical story slicing, where you
    slice stories into thin, end-to-end slices, and each slice is fully
    integrated and useful to a user. Vertical story slicing could be a post in
    its own right, and I won’t go into a full discussion of its merits here.
  </p>
  <p>
    The points I was trying to make were that vertical story slices would
    decrease delivery risk by delivering fully-integrated slices sooner, and
    would give us more flexibility in prioritising each slice independently of
    the others, perhaps deferring the low value ones for later. But in the end,
    vertical story slicing was new to most of my team and I wasn’t able to make
    a strong enough case of the benefits to convince my team, so I was
    out-voted. We proceeded with front-end/<wbr>back-end stories for a few
    sprints, but it didn’t really fix anything.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first problem was that we decided to finish the back-end before
    starting the front-end, as it’s good to complete dependencies before
    committing to a new story. This meant stories took twice as long, since we
    introduced a delay to the front-end work which wasn’t there before. We
    removed the delay, but still found we had to carry half-finished work
    across sprints. Even in parallel, the amount of work for the entire
    back-end or front-end is still too much for one sprint. We hadn’t fixed our
    original problem, we just changed how work was tracked.
  </p>
  <p>
    The real problem was that in sprint review, we couldn’t demonstrate
    half-finished work, and in order to show progress we had to re-estimate the
    remaining story-points to show how many had been “completed”. I can hear
    some of you groaning at this.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, the real problem was that we had no transparency in our
    progress, which is ultimately what our client cared about week-to-week.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a few sprints like this, one of my team members proposed we change
    the way we split up work. They’d been talking to the client, and what they
    really wanted to see was tangible progress every week, not made-up numbers
    decreasing in a spreadsheet.
  </p>
  <p>
    My team member proposed that we break stories up into smaller use-cases,
    like “the main case”, “this edge case”, “that edge case”, “what if this
    part wasn’t configurable at first?” Each use case is small enough to finish
    in one sprint, and can be demonstrated at sprint review. We can then
    prioritise the use cases, and deliver them one-by-one with a team focus on
    getting work-in-progress over the line before starting the next one. This
    would allow the client to see tangible progress every single week, and we
    would carry work across sprints less often.
  </p>
  <p>
    Basically, my team member pitched the idea of vertical story slicing back
    to me, only a few sprints after I’d already proposed it and we’d already
    voted it down. But I went along with it, we all got behind it, and after a
    couple more sprints the client loved it and so did we.
  </p>
  <p>
    So why wasn’t I successful at convincing the team about vertical story
    slicing in the first place? I pitched it wrong. I focused on the wrong
    benefits, and overlooked the specific problem we were trying to solve
    for—<wbr>transparency of progress.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re trying to drive change in your team or organisation, make sure
    that you frame your proposed solution around what people agree is the
    problem.
