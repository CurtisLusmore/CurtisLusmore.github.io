  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Trust the programmer
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    This phrase is part of the C philosophy, and has influenced the
    design of many programming languages. In general C usage, this is
    best observed by the use of pointer casts—<wbr>a mechanism by which the
    programmer can bypass the type system, trading compile-time type
    safety for flexibility and potentially incurring fatal crashes at
    run-time. The phrase needs little explanation—<wbr>the programmer knows
    what they’re doing, don’t get in their way.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Keep the spirit of C. The Committee kept as a major goal to preserve the
      traditional spirit of C. There are many facets of the spirit of C, but
      the essence is a community sentiment of the underlying principles upon
      which the C language is based. Some of the facets of the spirit of C can
      be summarized in phrases like
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trust the programmer.</li>
      <li>Don’t prevent the programmer from doing what needs to be done.</li>
      <li>Keep the language small and simple.</li>
      <li>Provide only one way to do an operation.</li>
      <li>Make it fast, even if it is not guaranteed to be portable.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    A lot of great software has been written in C, by a lot of brilliant
    programmers, making full use of this philosophy. When the programmer
    is Dennis Ritchie or one of his colleagues from Bell Labs, it’s
    pretty hard to argue with this. But what about for the rest of us
    mere mortals?
  </p>
  <p>
    I posit a counter-phrase.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Trust nobody, not even yourself
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    If you’re anything like me, you make mistakes while programming all
    the time. My mistakes vary from little things like typos in variable
    names to hard-to-find logic errors in large, complex systems. Some
    languages give you no protection against these errors—<wbr>I find most of
    my trivial mistakes are in interpreted languages like Python and
    JavaScript where I get no protection from typos. A step up from this
    are languages like Java where the static type-checker will pick up
    most typos—<wbr>I say most because it won’t prevent me from mistaking
    similarly named variables or array indices.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can add non-manual memory management or garbage collection to the
    list, which even modern systems programming languages like Go have.
    Memory management is a notoriously difficult problem that many C and
    C++ programmers struggle with, so it’s not surprising that modern
    languages, even ones striving for similar performance, are willing to
    make performance sacrifices to make the programmer’s life a little
    easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    But if I can’t even stop myself from making errors as trivial as
    typos, why should I trust myself to do anything right?
  </p>
  <p>
    The answer? I don’t, and neither should you.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ll give you a very simple example. At work a few months ago I was
    tasked with debugging why a particular query wasn’t being executed on
    first access to our database. The query in question clears the
    execution plan cache—<wbr>we found that clearing it gives us slightly
    better performance under certain circumstances. It wasn’t hard to
    track down the execution point in the code base. The code (C#) looked
    roughly like this.
  </p>
  <pre class="csharp">
// run on new thread, don't need to wait for completion
new Thread(() =>
{
  try
  {
      using (var connection = new SqlConnection())
      {
          connection.ExecuteQuery(ClearCacheQuery);
      }
  }
  catch
  {
      // suppress, nothing to do, don't want to crash
  }
}).Start();
</code></pre>
  <p>
    I immediately suspected that the query was throwing an exception, so
    I stuck a break point on the catch statement and started debugging. 
    Sure enough, that was the problem. The exception? Can’t execute query
    on a closed connection. We were missing a single line.
  </p>
  <pre class="csharp">
connection.Open();
connection.ExecuteQuery(ClearCacheQuery);
</code></pre>
  <p>
    A pretty easy mistake to make, but one that I can’t help but think
    could have been prevented by better tooling.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem in this case is that a <code>SqlConnection</code> is
    stateful—<wbr>there is a particular order that the methods need to be
    called in, and the compiler doesn’t enforce this order. And in this
    case it’s a pretty easy fix, but wouldn’t it be great if making the
    error wasn’t even possible? Take the opportunity to make a mistake
    out of the programmers hands entirely, make the compiler stop you
    from making the mistake.
  </p>
  <p>
    So how can we do this? Simple, make it a type error. You need to open
    a connection before you can execute queries, so take the query
    execution methods off the connection and put them on another class
    which you can only get by opening the connection.
  </p>
  <pre class="csharp">
try
{
  using (var connection = new SqlConnection())
  {
      var cursor = connection.Open();
      cursor.ExecuteQuery(ClearCacheQuery);
  }
}
catch
{
  // suppress, nothing to do, don’t want to crash
}
</code></pre>
  <p>
    Now it’s not even possible for the programmer to forget to open the
    connection. Humans are terrible at dealing with little technical
    pedantry like this, but that’s okay because computers are amazing at
    it! Why put the cognitive burden on the programmer when you can let
    the compiler handle it for you?
  </p>
  <p>
    This is just one small example. Have a look through your code base
    and think about how many stateful processes you have where executing
    methods or procedures in order is required but not enforced by the
    compiler. Do you think you might have slipped up in there once or
    twice, but you just haven’t noticed yet?
  </p>
  <p>
    Here’s another example. Many of the objects managed in our product
    have GUID keys, and so we have many methods which take a number of
    keys as arguments and retrieve various objects to do some work. Not
    all of these objects are of the same type, but because the keys are
    all of the same type, there’s nothing to stop us from mixing up the
    keys and using them to retrieve the wrong types of objects. How can I
    prevent myself from doing something like the following?
  </p>
  <pre class="csharp">
void DoWork(Guid gizmoKey, Guid hoozitKey)
{
  var gizmo = RetrieveGizmo(hoozitKey);
  var hoozit = RetrieveHoozit(gizmoKey);
  gizmo.Operate(hoozit);
}
</code></pre>
  <p>
    I’m going to go with “make it a type error” again. If our keys were
    of different types, it would be a type error to try passing the
    <code>hoozitKey</code> to <code>RetrieveGizmo</code>. But I don’t
    want to invent a new key type for every type of object, plus GUIDs
    are perfect keys anyway. So what should I do?
  </p>
  <p>
    Haskell has the best answer to this I’ve yet seen—<wbr>
    <code>newtypes</code>. A <code>newtype</code> declaration in Haskell
    defines a new type that is identical to an existing type in every way
    —<wbr>including its run-time behaviour and representation—<wbr>with zero
    overhead, and with the amazing property that the two types are
    incompatible at compile-time. As an example,
  </p>
  <pre class="haskell">
newtype GizmoKey = GizmoKey UUID
</code></pre>
  <p>
    This creates a new type called <code>GizmoKey</code> which is exactly
    the same thing as a <code>UUID</code> except for the fact that I
    can’t use a <code>GizmoKey</code> where a <code>UUID</code> is
    expected and vice versa—<wbr>but there’s absolutely no run-time
    performance penalty for this, the indirection disappears.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a fantastic solution and surprisingly useful. You can use it
    to prevent dimension errors—<wbr>adding meters to inches or something else
    nonsensical like that which is not checked by the compiler because
    both numbers are represented by floats. This is the kind of error
    that brought down the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter">Mars
    Climate Orbiter</a>, so don’t say it doesn’t happen, even to the best
    of us.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you look through your favourite programming language, you’ll see a
    bunch of features designed to make your life easier, and safer. But
    there are probably still dozens or hundreds of bugs lying dormant in
    your programs, out of reach of your compiler. Each time you discover
    one, think about how you could use language features to have the
    compiler enforce correctness for you. And if it can’t, think about
    what features you might add to help.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to see this idea taken to the extreme, have a look at
    this fantastic talk called
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X36ye-1x_HQ">Type Driven
    Development in Idris</a> which shows the cutting edge of type-system
    driven safety and correctness.
