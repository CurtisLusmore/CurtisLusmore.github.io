    The footy is back on again, and I was thinking about what lessons we can
    take from team sports, like the AFL, and apply to team environments at work,
    like a typical software development team. So in no particular order, here
    are ten lessons I think that we in software development could learn from
    AFL teams.
  </p>
  <p>
    1. Good teams aren’t a strict meritocracy. You couldn’t take the twenty-two
    best individual players in the league (e.g. as ranked by Brownlow votes
    from previous season) and expect to make a good team. You need diversity of
    skill-set to form a well-rounded team.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Okay, but what about a meritocracy for a specific position/<wbr>role?
    Still no. Some players work well in some teams but not others, because it
    really depends on how well they align with and compliment the existing
    team. There might be some characteristics that are non-negotiable in your
    environment, and others where you want variety and diversity. There’s no
    universal “best person for the job”. Everybody has something unique to
    offer.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Okay but what about a meritocracy for very similar players in the same
    position based on experience? Still no. You need to invest in your juniors.
    If you keep giving all the opportunities to your “best” and starve your
    juniors of experience they’ll never grow, and when the seniors leave you’ll
    be left with nothing.
  <p>
    4. Leadership is not the same thing as seniority. Don’t assume that your
    most senior people are automatically suitable leaders, or that your most
    junior aren’t. Good leaders can come from any level within your team, so
    don’t let lack of seniority stop good leaders from leading.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Leadership is not the same thing as management. The captains of teams
    don’t need to be “managers” or have org-hierarchy over their team. Don’t
    let “X isn’t mature/experienced enough to have management responsibilities”
    be an excuse to stop X from being a leader.
  </p>
  <p>
    6. Leadership is not a job function. “Captain” isn’t a position. Leaders
    can be in any role, and they don’t need to spend all of them time doing
    “leadership duties”.
  </p>
  <p>
    7. Roles are more important than job titles. There can be clearly defined
    positions/<wbr>roles, and for sure some people are better suited to some
    than others, but that doesn’t mean everybody needs a job title identifying
    their role. Stay flexible, let people fill the right role for the
    situation.
  </p>
  <p>
    8. You don’t need a ladder of titles to reward growth. There is no “Senior
    Full Forward”. That’s not to say all ladders are bad, just that promotions
    aren’t the only way to acknowledge and reward growth. Make sure people
    actually feel acknowledged and rewarded for growing.
  </p>
  <p>
    9. The best players don’t necessarily make the best coaches, and the best
    coaches don’t have to have been the best players. Being a good coach is not
    about being a skillful player and then teaching others how you do it, it's
    about serving the team and supporting each player to be the best they can
    be.
  </p>
  <p>
    10. And of course, the obvious lesson—it’s a team effort. Sure, the best
    players tend to be on one of the best teams, but the best individual player
    doesn’t make the best team. And no matter how good an individual effort is,
    what truly matters is the success of the team.
