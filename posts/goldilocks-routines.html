    I hate the lock on my front door. It’s pretty standard. Unlock with a
    key from the outside, lock by turning the knob on the inside. Open
    from the inside and the door stays locked. Seems pretty simple, so
    what’s not to like? If I was capable of following the routine
    perfectly, it wouldn’t be so bad. When I get home I unlock the door,
    step inside, turn the knob to lock the door, and put my keys down on
    my desk. When I leave home I grab my keys from my desk, open the
    door, step outside, and the door stays locked behind me.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem is that I don’t always follow the routine perfectly. I
    can be a forgetful person, and I don’t want to lock myself out by
    leaving the house having forgotten my keys. I know that if I’m
    leaving for work I’ll never forget to take my bag, so sometimes when
    I get home I put my keys in my bag instead of on my desk. But at the
    same time, I don’t want to train myself to think “I will never forget
    my keys because they’re always in my bag”, because sometimes I leave
    the house without my bag, if it’s not for work. This means that every
    time I leave the house, I do the dance where I step outside, keep the
    door propped open with my foot, and then double-check my bag or
    pockets for my keys.
  </p>
  <p>
    Okay good, I have my keys, I pull my foot away and the door shuts.
    How confident am I now that the door is locked? If I followed the
    routine correctly I would have locked it when I last got home. Did I
    remember to do that? Hard to say, so as I’m leaving home I also have
    to check that the door is locked by trying the handle. If I don’t
    bake this step into my routine,  later in the day I’ll worry that my
    door is unlocked and all my stuff is gone. But 99 times out of 100
    (hopefully more to be honest) the door was already locked, and so
    over time this check is delegated to auto-pilot. Did I really check
    it properly? It’s hard to say.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a similar issue while at home—did I remember to lock the door
    as I came in? It’s a simple enough action that I can do it on
    auto-pilot, so it can be hard to say for sure that I did.
  </p>
  <p>
    Are there betters locks?
  </p>
  <p>
    At my previous place I had a typical deadbolt that locks
    automatically as the door closes. When I was leaving the house I
    still had to do the foot-in-door check for keys to make sure I wasn’t
    about to lock myself out, but I didn’t have to test the handle (there
    wasn’t one anyway) because I knew that if the door was closed it was
    locked. This meant that I never had a nervous panic while out of the
    house trying to remember if I locked the door. Phewph, so that’s a
    bit better.
  </p>
  <p>
    What other kinds of locks are there?
  </p>
  <p>
    The place before that was a little unusual. Coming home was the
    same—unlock with a key from the outside, lock by turning the knob on
    the inside. But to open the door from the inside you had to unlock
    it. This seems objectively worse, right? Instead of having to test
    the handle on the way out, I had to actually re-lock the door.
    Testing the handle is just a confirmation step, so even if I forget
    to test the handle the door was probably locked and it’s not a big
    deal. But there, literally the last thing I did before leaving the
    house was unlock the door, so now the last step is crucial—if I
    forget to re-lock the door, it’s definitely unlocked.
  </p>
  <p>
    But I found I actually preferred this. Why? Because there I had to
    lock the door as I was leaving. I had no choice but to make it part
    of the routine, and it’s not easy to delegate this task to
    auto-pilot. In the end I was never worried while out and about
    whether the door was locked, because I just had to think back and
    remember the deliberate action of locking the door. I also didn’t
    have to worry about locking myself out, because it was literally
    impossible. To get outside I had to unlock the door, and the only way
    to lock the door again with me on the outside was to have my keys
    with me.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a routine becomes so mundane that you do it on auto-pilot, you
    risk not only not doing it correctly, but not even being able to
    remember whether you did it correctly. The best way to address this
    is to either make the routine fool-proof, like a self-locking
    deadbolt, or make it require more deliberative action, like locking
    the door from the outside.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you build software, what routines are your users performing that
    are so mundane that they do them on auto-pilot? Are you inadvertently
    providing your users with a bad user experience by building something
    easy enough that they do it on auto-pilot, but just tricky enough
    that they get it wrong? Think about a wizard that you next-next-next
    your way through before remembering that critical checkbox that you
    need to go back for. Think about those junk notifications that you
    swipe-swipe-swipe away and then just as you see one disappear you
    realise it looked important and now it’s gone forever.
  </p>
  <p>
    How could you design these systems differently to make them less
    error-prone for your users? You obviously don’t want an experience
    that’s so hard or frustrating that you struggle with it. But you also
    don’t want one that’s so easy or tedious that you skip through it
    without paying attention. You want something that’s just right.
