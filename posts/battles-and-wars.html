    In software there are battles and there are wars. The battles are the
    day-to-day—<wbr>dealing with tech debt, buggy code, flakey build systems,
    inadequate testing, unreliable stakeholders, vague and changing
    requirements, overbearing processes, the usual stuff. The wars are the
    bigger picture—<wbr>hitting a deadline, delivering a big project,
    developing strong relationships, shipping product.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is an infinite stream of battles. Regardless of whether you win, lose
    or surrender, there will always be more battles to fill your day-to-day.
    Battles come and go all the time, and they’re always changing. Wars, on the
    other hand, play out over a much longer timeframe—<wbr>it takes time for
    the tides of war to change, and you can’t always choose the wars you fight
    in.
  </p>
  <p>
    Teams can win every single battle they face but still lose the war, if
    they’re fighting the wrong battles. It’s incredibly frustrating, because
    it feels like you’re kicking arse. You’re hitting all your targets and
    deadlines, performance reviews are great, the day-to-day is great, but over
    time it feels like your work doesn’t matter.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s worse when you aren’t even winning the battles. A common trap that I
    see teams fall into is to become swamped by the desire to win all of their
    current battles, which can actually just force them permamently into
    defence. Every little piece of tech debt or code smell needs to be fixed,
    every manual process needs to be automated, every minor issue needs a
    proper fix instead of a reasonable workaround. As I said, there is an
    infinite stream of battles, and as soon as one is over there’ll just be
    more. If you try to fight your way out of every single battle you often
    just wear yourself out, giving you a perpetual feeling of exhaustion. The
    same thing can happen if you try to fight too many battles at the same
    time. You stretch yourself too thin and end up losing everything—<wbr>the
    divide-<wbr>and-<wbr>conquer defeat.
  </p>
  <p>
    But you can use the infinite stream of battles to your advantage, because
    it means there are plenty to choose from. Look for the strategic battles,
    the high-value problems that give you real leverage, and focus all of your
    attention on winning those even if it means surrendering other battles. If
    you win a few of the right battles you can start to shift the momentum of
    bigger wars, and everything will start to feel easier. The high-value
    problems are the constraints of the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints">theory of
    constraints</a>, which when lifted will increase the throughput of the
    system—<wbr>in a development team, the throughput is your velocity, or the
    rate at which work gets completed. Winning battles which aren’t constraints
    won’t increase throughput, or at least not considerably.
  </p>
  <p>
    And if you notice yourself getting overly emotional about your work—<wbr
    >the exhilarating highs when you get on a roll of productivity, and the
    crushing lows when you’re ten rabbit holes deep and you seem to only be
    getting further away from your goal—<wbr>you’re probably too invested in
    the battles. Take a step back and make sure you’re winning the war, which
    is what really matters.
