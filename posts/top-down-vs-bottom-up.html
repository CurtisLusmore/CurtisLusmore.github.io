  <h1>Top-down vs Bottom-up</h1>
</header>
<section>
  <p>
    I like to look at the world around me in layers of hierarchy, and there are
    two lenses that I apply when thinking about how these layers come together.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first lens, “top-down”, looks at the world by starting at the top,
    something high-level or abstract, and then working down to the lower
    layers. The second lens, “bottom-up”, is the opposite—<wbr>starting with
    something low-level or concrete and working up. This sounds pretty
    vague, but you can apply these two lenses to pretty much everything, so
    let’s explore by looking at a few examples.
  </p>
  <p>
    Top-down learning is starting with a high-level concept and then digging
    deeper and deeper, asking questions like “why is that? how does that work?
    what does that mean?” Bottom-up is learning fundamentals and building them
    up until you can explain higher-level concepts.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf"
    >A Mathematician’s Lament</a> is a great essay about how the way we teach
    mathematics in a bottom-up way, by starting with low-level mathematical
    concepts and techniques and building them up into a useful model of the
    world, can cause people to lose interest early on. He argues that this
    approach is backwards to the way that most people prefer to learn.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is perhaps backed up by Richard Feynman, one of my favourite teachers,
    who explains in the video <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36GT2zI8lVA">Richard Feynman.
    Why.</a> how repeatedly asking “why?” helps you start with a simple
    high-level view of the world and dig deeper and deeper into physics, whilst
    always being rooted in a real-world problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Top-down works great when you know what you’re trying to learn, when you
    have a specific goal in mind. Have you ever taken an online training course
    where you have access to the reference material while taking the quiz? Most
    people find that it’s easier to read a question and then go looking for the
    answer, than to read through all the content and try to memorise it well
    enough to answer every question.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, if you’re trying to learn a foreign language it can help to have
    a pressing need to actually use what you’re learning. When I lived in Japan
    for a year I found it relatively easy to learn the language because I was
    using it every day—<wbr>it wasn’t really a choice. Conversely, my attempts
    to learn Chinese have failed miserably for the last 7 years because,
    despite my wife being Chinese, I don’t have the same pressing need to learn
    and use the language every single day.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of this isn’t to say that top-down is the best way to learn. Sometimes
    you don’t know what you’ll need to know and it’s good to build up a solid
    base of fundamental knowledge. This is essentially what university courses
    try to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wrote about top-down programming in my post <a
    href="https://lusmo.re/posts/programming-by-wishful-thinking">Programming
    by Wishful Thinking</a>, where you start with high-level functions that
    call mid-level (yet to be defined) functions and implement your way down to
    low-level functions. Compilers don’t really like this approach, though, and
    are constantly pushing us towards a bottom-up approach by forcing us to
    define things before we use them.
  </p>
  <p>
    How do you think about your career progression? Do you have a high-level
    goal for where you see yourself in 20 years, and then plot out a path for
    getting there? Or do you use a bottom-up approach, building on your
    experiences, looking for the best opportunities/<wbr>building blocks you
    can find now and working your way up, perhaps unsure of what exactly you’re
    building towards? Some people need to have that anchor in the future that
    pulls them towards their goal, and they assess every career opportunity in
    terms of how it helps them get there. Others like to go with the flow and
    see where life takes them.
  </p>
  <p>
    What about product ideas? Some people start with a high-level goal or
    vision that they want to achieve, and then develop a mission or strategy
    for achieving it, and then a concrete plan or backlog of features to
    deliver it. Others start by just putting blocks together, building from the
    tools and skills available to them, and then seeing to what mission/<wbr
    >vision it leads. Airbnb’s mission is to build a world where you belong,
    but they didn’t know that when they started with renting air mattresses.
    They got there from the bottom-up.
  </p>
  <p>
    What about software testing? Unit testing is a bottom-up approach, focused
    on literally the smallest units of software. If a unit test fails, is it
    the code or the test that’s wrong? Hard to know when you aren’t looking at
    the big picture. End-to-end tests are the top-down approach, which focus on
    higher-level use cases. But if an end-to-end test fails, it’s hard to know
    where in the code-base the bug is. You need a good mixture of both.
  </p>
  <p>
    Top-down and bottom-up can also apply to writing and story-telling itself.
    Informational writing is often done bottom-up, where you start by laying
    out the facts and then build and build until you reach a conclusion. This
    can be really boring, and a common reaction to this style is “get to the
    point!” and “where are you going with this?” Academic writing often uses
    this approach, which is why they usually stick an abstract at the beginning
    to summarise the conclusion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The conclusion contextualises the facts and helps the reader follow along
    because they can understand how your points fit into the big picture.
    Stories also often use this approach, because without that up-front context
    it provides a sense of mystery and intrigue.
  </p>
  <p>
    The top-down approach is to start with high-level statements and dig down
    into the details as required. This can start out quite vague, and a common
    reaction to this style is “what are you actually saying?” and “what does
    this mean in practice?” Marketing copy for software often uses this
    approach, because it gives you an overview of why you might use the
    software quickly and then lets you dig deeper into the technicals of how it
    works if you think it might be a good fit.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are alternatives and variations to these two lenses too. “Outside-in”
    is where you start simultaneously at the highest level and the lowest
    level, and work your way in until they meet in the middle. As an example,
    you might have a long-term goal for your career, and in the immediate-term
    you make career moves based on opportunities available to you, but you’re
    still working out the mid-term plan that joins the two.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course there’s “middle-out”, made infamous by the scene in <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex1JuIN0eaA">Silicon Valley</a>. An
    example of this could be that you have a great product idea (mid-level),
    but you’re still working out the features/<wbr>UX (low-level) and the
    vision/<wbr>business model (high-level).
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally there’s what I call the “lightning-method”. If you’ve ever seen a
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQKhIK4pvYo">lightning strike in
    slow-motion</a>, you’ll know that it starts in the cloud, branches and
    branches searching for the ground, and then as soon as the connection is
    made it surges back up. An example of this is finding <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product/market_fit">product/<wbr>market
    fit</a>, by starting from the bottom exploring with features in search of
    your users’ real problem. Once the connection is made you flip focus, the
    problem you are solving becomes the vision, and you work your way down from
    there.
  </p>
  <p>
    When thinking about writing this post, I struggled for a long time with the
    question: should the post about top-down and bottom-up be written in the
    top-down style or the bottom-up style? Wouldn’t it be interesting if I
    could use a weird mix of the two at different parts of this post to
    emphasise the way they work?
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe some day I’ll attempt that perfect meta-post, but for now this is
    what you get. I’ll just leave you with the following questions. Where in
    your life do you apply these lenses? And the more interesting question, can
    you think of cases where you use one but you’ve never tried the others?
