          <li>Anybody seent his talk?</li>
          <li>One of many by the original authors lamenting the “Agile
            Industrial Complex”</li>
          <li>There are several others, most recently Martin Fowler</li>
          <li>Go look up what the authors have said about it recently</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>The metaphor I like to use is the film and TV industry</li>
          <li>Hire the best, don’t rely on formulae</li>
          <li>Pilot, renew in installments, invest in what works, can what
            doesn’t, profits fund future work</li>
          <li>Engage with audience, find out what they like, make it</li>
          <li>Get a feedback loop and always be willing to change or adapt</li>
          <li>Nobody would write all nine seasons, find whatever cast you can
            afford, film and produce it all, and then release it</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>As an extreme example, sports gambling, or tipping competitions
            in particular</li>
          <li>Of course you think about it at the start of the season</li>
          <li>But you would never consider locking in your tips before the
            season starts</li>
          <li>Incorporate new information as it becomes available</li>
          <li>Be prepared to change your plans</li>
        </ul>
